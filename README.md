# Dotfiles
Various .rc files for my command line experience in OS X.

***NOTE***: These are my own config files. You are free to take anything but
make sure you know what it does. I don't and never will tailor my config files
to suit others.

## Branches
I "organize" my config files for Linux on a separate branch.

Check out (pardon the pun) my
[Linux](https://github.com/ajh17/dotfiles/tree/linux-branch) branch instead.
