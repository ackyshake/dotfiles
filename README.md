## Caveats:
Although I try to make this work on Linux too, there are some things that are
only configured for OS X. I don't expect anyone to clone this project and start
using it right away. This environment is made only for me, not for anyone else.

Also, this will obviously not work with Windows. Ever.

If you use OS X, there is likely no configuration required, outside of
installing packages from homebrew.
