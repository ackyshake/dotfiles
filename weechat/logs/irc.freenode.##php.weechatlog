2013-11-10 21:58:44	@cythrawll	hashguy, but you're falsely assuming that all the classes are there at a glance
2013-11-10 21:59:11	@cythrawll	which why you have more faith than that, than loading one central autoloader that works for your entire project is beyond me.
2013-11-10 21:59:19	@cythrawll	because it's about equal amount of work there.
2013-11-10 21:59:32	Watabou	Anyone use Amazon's free tier RDS? I'm trying to connect it with my php script which is failing. However, I can connect to it fine with the mysql command line. 
2013-11-10 21:59:32	@cythrawll	the problem is with your, there's actually
2013-11-10 21:59:35	@cythrawll	let me rephrase
2013-11-10 21:59:41	@cythrawll	it actually takes more faith in yours.
2013-11-10 22:00:04	hashguy	cythrawll: *shrug* I have more faith in people doing code reviews than I do in autoloaders, if that's what you mean
2013-11-10 22:00:07	@cythrawll	because you got a large codebase and multiple places wehre things can go wrong.
2013-11-10 22:00:13	@cythrawll	where as I, have the autoloader.
2013-11-10 22:00:33	@cythrawll	right but you have to code review all those requires

2013-11-10 22:00:43	@cythrawll	whereas I have to only code review the autoloader
2013-11-10 22:01:13	@cythrawll	the place where things can go wrong is that an unintentional audoloader gets loaded.
2013-11-10 22:01:13	hashguy	Sure, whereas you have to code-review all the autoloaders, and the autoloaders' autoloaders, and the autoloaders' autoloaders' autoloaders...
2013-11-10 22:01:13	@cythrawll	and I have one place to make sure that doesn't happen
2013-11-10 22:01:19	@cythrawll	no
2013-11-10 22:01:25	@cythrawll	just the one autoloader for the project
2013-11-10 22:01:39	@cythrawll	if there's more autoloaders, than the one I need, that's the issue
2013-11-10 22:01:43	@cythrawll	and that's an easy fix.
2013-11-10 22:01:47	Watabou	Does anyone know what this mysqli_connect error means: http://pastebin.com/3C0C40VF or what I'm doing wrong?
2013-11-10 22:01:53	hashguy	Until you pull in that 3rd party library that uses an autoloader, and it pulls in 3 other libraries that all use their own autoloaders...
2013-11-10 22:02:05	Watabou	And yes, in the actual PHP file, I provide the database credentials.
2013-11-10 22:02:25	@cythrawll	hashguy, in order to do composer, they all work with composer's autoloader which works with PSR-9
2013-11-10 22:02:27	@cythrawll	err 0
2013-11-10 22:02:32	hashguy	Watabou: It means your PHP can't resolve that hostname
2013-11-10 22:02:41	@cythrawll	and if they don't work with that standard, than I'll have to fork that project and make it compliant. :p
2013-11-10 22:02:56	@cythrawll	hashguy, you have the same problem for third party systems that don't use your requirement system
2013-11-10 22:03:09	Watabou	hashguy: Hmm that's weird because I can use the mysql command line and provide the same host name to connect to it fine. 
2013-11-10 22:03:10	@cythrawll	you have to rework all those requires into your code
2013-11-10 22:03:21	hashguy	I do, which is why I argue so much against autoloading. I'm trying to convince you all to stop forcing it on me through 3rd party code.
2013-11-10 22:03:21	@cythrawll	which causes more intemetn knowledge of a library than you really need.
2013-11-10 22:03:33	@cythrawll	hashguy, and you're nuts
2013-11-10 22:03:56	@cythrawll	because you have an imagined problem just becaue you failed to correctly resolve a few autoloaidng problems which end up being simple fixes
2013-11-10 22:04:31	@cythrawll	Watabou, as the same user that's running PHP?
2013-11-10 22:04:40	@cythrawll	Watabou, what operating system is this on?
2013-11-10 22:04:54	Watabou	Yes, and this is on OS X

2013-11-10 22:05:25	@cythrawll	oh darn, I was hoping it was the issue where I see selinux getting in the way.
2013-11-10 22:05:35	Watabou	I provide the exact same host, user, password, port for the mysql command line client and I can connect and create tables just fine.
2013-11-10 22:05:47	Watabou	Not sure why PHP is not liking the host name
2013-11-10 22:06:05	Watabou	Yeah I read something about that on stackoverflow, but I'm not sure if that applies to me.
2013-11-10 22:06:17	hashguy	Watabou: var_dump(gethostbyname("host"));
2013-11-10 22:06:23	hashguy	where "host" is your actual hostname
2013-11-10 22:06:35	Watabou	Okay, let me try that.
2013-11-10 22:07:14	@cythrawll	hashguy, to be honest, the working towards composer means less autoloaders, means more centralized standardized autoloading.
2013-11-10 22:07:21	@cythrawll	and hashguy you need to be realistic here
2013-11-10 22:07:26	@cythrawll	autoloading is here to stay.
2013-11-10 22:07:48	hashguy	cythrawll: Well, as I've tried to say since the beginning, my problem with autoloading in PHP is that it's not only considered "OK", but "good practice" for everyone to create their own class loaders (PSR-0 practically requires it); whereas in most other languages, it's either difficult to do, or at least commonly considered a castration offense
2013-11-10 22:08:09	@cythrawll	hashguy, actually PSR-0 doesn't require any such thing.
2013-11-10 22:08:20	hashguy	It's standard for how to write your own class loader
2013-11-10 22:08:25	Watabou	hashguy: I get what looks like an IP address. 
2013-11-10 22:08:26	@cythrawll	and composer only uses one autoloader.

2013-11-10 22:08:39	@cythrawll	which is flexible enough for any standard compliant library to use.
2013-11-10 22:08:44	hashguy	You can't create PSR-0 compliant code without writing your own class loader
2013-11-10 22:08:52	@cythrawll	hashguy, false, i've done it.
2013-11-10 22:09:06	@cythrawll	and so has composer.
2013-11-10 22:09:29	@cythrawll	the other autoloaders come from people who haven't embraced composer and PSR-0 fully.
2013-11-10 22:09:46	hashguy	cythrawll: Well, where I was headed with my last comment about "since the beginning" is, I guess if composer is going to fix that problem, I'll just ignore it instead of hating it :)
2013-11-10 22:09:48	@cythrawll	whcih thanks to composer is becomming a taboo castration offense to make your own and not use composer's
2013-11-10 22:10:08	@cythrawll	hashguy, right but now you're part of the problem ;)
2013-11-10 22:10:22	Watabou	hashguy: I get back the IP Address 54.201.45.31. Which I ran whois on, and it's owned by Amazon.com.
2013-11-10 22:10:26	hashguy	but you can't write PSR-0 compliant code without an autoloader because PSR-0 doesn't actually PROVIDE an autoloader, it just gives requirements for how autoloaded code be resolved.
2013-11-10 22:10:40	hashguy	cythrawll: No I'm not, because I still won't ever ever ever use autoloading.
2013-11-10 22:10:43	hashguy	I'll drop PHP first
2013-11-10 22:10:55	@cythrawll	hashguy, right so composer provides an autoloader that works for PSR-0 libraries.
2013-11-10 22:11:09	@cythrawll	hashguy, then maybe you should drop PHP.
2013-11-10 22:11:20	@cythrawll	and do the community a favor.
2013-11-10 22:11:34	hashguy	as soon as I have no customers who want to pay me to fix their problems because they're all convinced autoloader is the heaven you think it is, I will
2013-11-10 22:11:36	@cythrawll	don't let the doorknob hit you on the way out.
2013-11-10 22:11:53	hashguy	until then, it's still making our consulting firm lots of cash, so *shrug*

2013-11-10 22:13:10	r00ch	how can I find out what lines of code are been executed? hopefully in real-time?
2013-11-10 22:13:24	@cythrawll	r00ch, use remote debugging
2013-11-10 22:13:31	r00ch	how?
2013-11-10 22:13:35	@cythrawll	xdebug or zend debugger add addons to PHP
2013-11-10 22:13:44	@cythrawll	then you hook up a debugging client to it
2013-11-10 22:13:48	@cythrawll	usually provided with an IDE
2013-11-10 22:13:56	@cythrawll	but there are standalone debugger clients as well

2013-11-10 22:17:18	GoogleGuy	Especially with remote debugging :)
2013-11-10 22:18:07	GoogleGuy	You're better off finding the inflection point and running a manual backtrace.
2013-11-10 22:18:35	r00ch	GoogleGuy, how do you do that?
2013-11-10 22:19:28	@cythrawll	r00ch, oh god that's horrible, dont' do that.
2013-11-10 22:20:00	@cythrawll	r00ch, I don't know why GoogleGuy says it doesn't work very well, never had issue with it.
2013-11-10 22:20:20	@cythrawll	but in any sense it would make more sense to do debugging with it until it doesn't work
2013-11-10 22:20:22	@cythrawll	than do what GoogleGuy says
2013-11-10 22:20:40	@cythrawll	because what GoogleGuy says is a bit more troublesome

2013-11-10 22:22:19	GoogleGuy	Way too many gotchyas
2013-11-10 22:22:51	Slade-	oh thats crap.. pg_query_params doesnt automatically handle nulls correctly
