2013-11-04 23:07:13	yudi	apart from fgets, is there any other function that can seek until it hits a new line character?
2013-11-04 23:08:34	moop	yudi: well those functions are usually just loops that go over each letter until you hit a newline symbol
2013-11-04 23:08:43	moop	so you can write one yourself i guess?

2013-11-05 09:25:16	pecorade	inf-groupoid: a friend gave me that link. I think it's from some anime.
2013-11-05 09:25:24	inf-groupoid	katyusha: Lots of languages compile to native binaries: Rust, Haskell, OCaml, Standard ML...
2013-11-05 09:25:35	inf-groupoid	pecorade: Ah!
2013-11-05 09:25:38	PearFish	Denommus, well, stallman is still voting for hurd, so I'm not terribly concerned about what he originally envisioned.
2013-11-05 09:25:39	amigojapan	katyusha: you are talking of scripting languages, many languages compile to binary
2013-11-05 09:25:41	Denommus	katyusha: Common Lisp, Scheme...
2013-11-05 09:25:48	Denommus	PearFish: Hurd is awesome
2013-11-05 09:26:02	PearFish	Denommus, awesome and 20 years late.
2013-11-05 09:26:09	rindolf	Denommus: Hurd is awesome? WTF?
2013-11-05 09:26:14	rindolf	Denommus: Hurd is not functional.
2013-11-05 09:26:21	PearFish	it runs.
2013-11-05 09:26:22	rindolf	And it's under-developed.
2013-11-05 09:26:23	PearFish	Mostly
2013-11-05 09:26:35	Denommus	PearFish: there are still features in Hurd that you won't find in modern OSs, sadly. Unix is a bitch, it hindered OS research for years
2013-11-05 09:26:35	inf-groupoid	lol, mostly
2013-11-05 09:26:40	rindolf	Things crash a lot on it.
2013-11-05 09:26:55	Denommus	I'm talking about its concept, I'm aware that Hurd still needs a lot of resources to be usable
2013-11-05 09:27:02	katyusha	I've asked this question before a while ago but I forget the answer
2013-11-05 09:27:06	katyusha	Why does it seem most game devs use C++ as opposed to C
2013-11-05 09:27:20	PearFish	katyusha, C makes object orientation very painful.
2013-11-05 09:27:26	rindolf	katyusha: because games need a lot of objects and classes.
2013-11-05 09:27:28	inf-groupoid	katyusha: Because it offers a balance between predictable performance and resource management and reasonably high-level abstractions.
2013-11-05 09:27:29	Denommus	katyusha: anyway, yes, C is one of the languages with the fastest implementations around. I think only Fortran surpasses C. But, for most use cases, you don't NEED all this speed
2013-11-05 09:27:47	PearFish	C++ is a lot more convenient while allowing you to remove almost all the abstractions you don't want.
2013-11-05 09:27:53	inf-groupoid	katyusha: C gives you predictable performance and resource management as well, but it is severely lacking in the abstraction department.
2013-11-05 09:28:35	inf-groupoid	Denommus: Fortran surpasses C, but only at the cost of being heavily biased towards a specific niche.

2013-11-05 09:29:01	Denommus	inf-groupoid: C is also heavily biased towards its own niche, otherwise it would have more general abstractions
2013-11-05 09:29:03	PearFish	In general purpose code, C has actually surpassed fortran simply due to having better compilers.
2013-11-05 09:29:03	inf-groupoid	Denommus: Stuff like assuming no aliasing is perfect for numerical computing, and awful for everything else.

2013-11-05 09:30:01	Denommus	inf-groupoid: we agree on that. But my point is just that having C performance is less important than most beginners think
2013-11-05 09:30:26	PearFish	Hopefully we can all agree on that :)

2013-11-05 09:34:41	inf-groupoid	Denommus: Sure, raw performance as a design consideration is often overrated by newbies. But I think the case for deterministic resource management is not just a matter of performance. It is also a matter of elegance: garbage collection is only nice when you truly do not need to care how it works, but when you start having to do stuff like manually tuning GC parameters, things quickly become ugly.

2013-11-05 09:36:15	PearFish	inf-groupoid, to be fair there are still better ways for deterministic memory management than C. Rust comes to mind.
2013-11-05 09:36:23	inf-groupoid	PearFish: Yeah. Indeed.
2013-11-05 09:36:30	Belxjander	vendu: real men can make the GC part of the standard operation so it doesn't behave stupidly ;)
2013-11-05 09:36:43	vendu	belxjander, =)
2013-11-05 09:36:50	inf-groupoid	Rust is precisely what comes to my mind when I think "deterministic resource management done right".
2013-11-05 09:36:52	diminoten	I think it's kind of unfair to compare C to rust
2013-11-05 09:37:03	diminoten	because rust was built specifically to replace C, wasn't it?
2013-11-05 09:37:05	katyusha	So.. does this mean everybody over at cat-v.org and suckless are insane

2013-11-05 09:37:50	inf-groupoid	diminoten: It is meant to be more of a C++ killer. Rust's several pointer types are not going to convince any C programmers to switch languages.

2013-11-05 09:39:06	inf-groupoid	diminoten: It is familiar enough for C++ programmers that they might consider it, but for pretty much everyone else, it is completely alien. And the learning curve is rather steep, especially for hacker types.

2013-11-05 09:39:38	Denommus	PearFish: yes, but then it's just stuff not really abstracted. For instance, doing closures in C is a pain
2013-11-05 09:39:43	PearFish	yeah
2013-11-05 09:40:21	inf-groupoid	Denommus: You simply don't do them. If you think in terms of polymorphic higher-order functions, well, pretend you are the compiler and manually monomorphize and inline them.
2013-11-05 09:40:28	diminoten	ice skating on asphalt is a pain too
2013-11-05 09:40:42	bstrie	inf-groupoid: I disagree that the learning curve is super steep for hacker types. more like the learning curve of systems programming in general is a vertical cliff for anyone raised on java and python
2013-11-05 09:40:51	Denommus	PearFish: for a language that priviledges creating new and modular abstractions, Lisp is a better example. You don't have a feature, you create it
2013-11-05 09:41:37	PearFish	Denommus, I'm not trying to argue the superiority of lisp's approach for stuff, but it's also much harder to optimize lisp.

2013-11-05 11:00:06	maxmahem	Within a record type, a record can have multiple different kinds of data like. Should I just make these member variables of the inherited record class, or would it make or more sense to put it in like a array in the parent type.
2013-11-05 11:00:42	diminoten	sounds like overengineering
2013-11-05 11:01:18	maxmahem	since every record does have multipe 'fields' within it. But exactly what the fields represent differs.
2013-11-05 11:01:22	maxmahem	probably :)
2013-11-05 11:02:03	jrslepak	how many kinds of data can a record be?

2013-11-05 18:50:56	drostie	or to process a tree.
2013-11-05 18:53:42	Engen	Ah okay. DFS has recursive property to process an entire tree. Or it can be implemented with a stack.
2013-11-05 18:54:08	Engen	I like the example on stackoverflow a lot.
2013-11-05 18:54:11	Engen	If you had an infinite sized graph then DFS would never find an element if it exists outside of the first path it chooses. It would essentially keep going down the first path and would never find the element. The BFS would eventually find the element.
2013-11-05 18:54:46	drostie	well, as long as the nodes don't have an infinite number of vertices coming off of them as well...

2013-11-05 20:56:46	spjt	blargo: C will be harder, especially without a degree.
2013-11-05 20:56:48	Engen	ahah
2013-11-05 20:56:58	blargo	lol
2013-11-05 20:57:22	Engen	blargo: I think that the more online oriented languages will get you a job easier based on the general consensus I would say
2013-11-05 20:57:33	blargo	oh i see
2013-11-05 20:57:43	spjt	I could be wrong, but most C jobs I see are either legacy maintenance or embedded stuff
2013-11-05 20:58:08	blargo	what about java?
2013-11-05 20:58:10	nisstyre	spjt: you can get a job writing device drivers
2013-11-05 20:58:11	manamonghippos	Not that embedded stuff can't be interesting
2013-11-05 20:58:12	nisstyre	those are mostly in C
2013-11-05 20:58:20	spjt	PHP/Jquery, you get a lot of "We need a webpage" people
2013-11-05 20:58:21	nisstyre	also kernel development can sometimes make you money
2013-11-05 20:58:26	nisstyre	(Redhat, Intel, etc)
2013-11-05 20:58:31	blargo	i wana do embedded but would it be harder without degree
2013-11-05 20:58:32	bubchi89	nisstyre: what kind of kernel development team would hire someone with 0 experience?
2013-11-05 20:58:37	nisstyre	bubchi89: none
2013-11-05 20:58:42	nisstyre	that would be dumb
2013-11-05 20:58:56	nisstyre	bubchi89: the great thing is that you can contribute with no experience though

2013-11-05 20:59:37	bubchi89	he can learn a bit of that and try and do freelance work or something

2013-11-05 21:00:07	bubchi89	nisstyre: the conceptual difficulty for webdev vs. kernel hacking is very large
2013-11-05 21:00:12	bubchi89	you can make a basic website and be an idiot
2013-11-05 21:00:18	blargo	ive been learing C for a few years but never got past the first "teach ourself books" and Ive progammed a "database" app. but i want a job
2013-11-05 21:00:19	bubchi89	you can't really be an idiot and contribute anything meaningful to a kernel
2013-11-05 21:00:27	nisstyre	also most recruiters are just trawling for keywords like you said
2013-11-05 21:00:39	bubchi89	sounds like you need to fix your attitude first where you're trying to avoid doing work and get a job... lol

2013-11-05 21:01:45	manamonghippos	blargo: I agree with the web development approach to getting a job, Bootstrap, JS, JQuery, all that jazz. I can't comment much about PHP though, I've written <= 50 lines of it.
2013-11-05 21:02:03	spjt	oh yeah, bootstrap.
2013-11-05 21:02:06	spjt	learn that
2013-11-05 21:02:36	nisstyre	spjt: he should still try to get a good one
2013-11-05 21:02:45	nisstyre	*trying* isn't going to hurt him

2013-11-05 21:03:43	manamonghippos	blargo what kind of position are you in? Are you broke?

2013-11-05 21:03:56	nisstyre	I mean if your writing skills aren't shit
2013-11-05 21:04:01	blargo_	trying to save
2013-11-05 21:04:20	manamonghippos	So you need a job fairly quickly?
2013-11-05 21:04:23	blargo_	exactly
2013-11-05 21:04:30	bubchi89	did you actually manage to get a programming job with no degree, while you weren't in college, with no projects?
2013-11-05 21:04:34	bubchi89	nisstyre:
2013-11-05 21:04:36	nisstyre	bubchi89: yes
2013-11-05 21:04:39	GeorgeTorwell	you could always move to India or Pakistan and drive a cab there.
2013-11-05 21:04:42	bubchi89	how many interviews did you send out
2013-11-05 21:04:45	spjt	It doesn't matter. What you're looking for is industry work experience. It doesn't matter if the job sucks, the first job is just something to put on your resume while you look for the next one.
2013-11-05 21:04:46	bubchi89	also 25k sounds like an internship
2013-11-05 21:04:46	nisstyre	bubchi89: well I am in university
2013-11-05 21:04:51	bubchi89	okay that's a difference
2013-11-05 21:04:52	bubchi89	a large one
2013-11-05 21:04:53	nisstyre	bubchi89: but I had never taken a single programming course
2013-11-05 21:04:55	blargo_	i have over 10 hours in college but not in programming classes yet
2013-11-05 21:05:17	nisstyre	bubchi89: it was sort of like a paid internship I guess
2013-11-05 21:05:20	blargo_	25k is more than i make working now
2013-11-05 21:05:21	spjt	"I'm working at X as a programmer and haven't been fired yet" is a huge resume booster
2013-11-05 21:05:21	blargo_	lol
2013-11-05 21:05:21	nisstyre	but officially it was a job
2013-11-05 21:05:26	bubchi89	did you get the interview via a job conference?

2013-11-05 21:07:20	bubchi89	i dunno
2013-11-05 21:07:29	bubchi89	i think in most industries with that sort of resume/application you wouldn't ahve gotten a second glance
2013-11-05 21:07:40	w0rm_x	blargo, there are plenty of projects to contribute to if you're good enough with C.
2013-11-05 21:07:41	bubchi89	it depends though
2013-11-05 21:07:46	bubchi89	if your github has demoable software then maybe
2013-11-05 21:07:48	spjt	blargo_: Set up a server and write a PHP app that says "Hello World". Then, make a static HTML button with a div that loads a string from the server using jQuery.
2013-11-05 21:07:50	nisstyre	bubchi89: programming is pretty unique in that respect
2013-11-05 21:08:02	bubchi89	well i knew software was easy to get a job in
2013-11-05 21:08:07	bubchi89	if you have adegree you won't be unemployed
2013-11-05 21:08:09	bubchi89	it's like impossible
2013-11-05 21:08:18	bubchi89	but i didn't think a random joe could get a job as a dev
2013-11-05 21:08:20	nisstyre	bubchi89: and there have been lots of very successful people with no degree
2013-11-05 21:08:21	blargo_	w0rm_x: that was what i was thinking, do some open souece projects. i have some ideas for an android app that may sell too
2013-11-05 21:08:28	bubchi89	i was thinking freelancing might be the easiest avenue
2013-11-05 21:08:29	nisstyre	bubchi89: they can
2013-11-05 21:08:38	bubchi89	nisstyre: their story is different because they were friends at a startup
2013-11-05 21:08:39	nisstyre	bubchi89: it was VERY common in the late 90s/early 2000s
2013-11-05 21:08:40	w0rm_x	blargo_, gcc is one.
2013-11-05 21:08:41	bubchi89	or like met people through irc

2013-11-05 21:09:59	nisstyre	yeah, exactly
2013-11-05 21:10:01	manamonghippos	I also know an addict with no degree, but not everyone with a degree is an addict.
2013-11-05 21:10:03	bubchi89	that's not true

2013-11-05 21:10:08	manamonghippos	with no degree*
2013-11-05 21:10:12	nisstyre	bubchi89: so?
2013-11-05 21:10:25	nisstyre	bubchi89: I'm not saying you can be a medical doctor with no degree
2013-11-05 21:10:35	spjt	A lot of people are claiming to be programmers now because that's where the jobs are
2013-11-05 21:10:37	bubchi89	my point is that making blanket statements
2013-11-05 21:10:43	bubchi89	like you just need to be good, are garbage
2013-11-05 21:10:46	w0rm_x	try apply for the big ones without a degree ;)
2013-11-05 21:10:47	bubchi89	you need to do very specific things
2013-11-05 21:10:52	nisstyre	bubchi89: you need to be productive and good
2013-11-05 21:10:58	bubchi89	that's equally generic
2013-11-05 21:10:59	nisstyre	productivity is hard for both groups
2013-11-05 21:11:06	TacitBlu1	many companies don't care about the full degree but prefer to see the specific courses and credits
2013-11-05 21:11:28	nisstyre	bubchi89: you need to learn more about the history of computing
2013-11-05 21:11:41	nisstyre	there've been lots of very influential/talented people with no formal education
2013-11-05 21:11:45	nisstyre	some of them went on to get it
2013-11-05 21:11:45	bubchi89	wow
2013-11-05 21:11:49	bubchi89	when did i claim that that's not true
2013-11-05 21:11:51	bubchi89	what the fuck
2013-11-05 21:12:00	TacitBlu1	the self-taught is often suspect to have deficiencies in fundamental areas
2013-11-05 21:12:02	bubchi89	let me reiterate
2013-11-05 21:12:07	bubchi89	you guys are conflating too many things together
2013-11-05 21:12:14	bubchi89	i said, software is unique in the sense that
2013-11-05 21:12:15	nisstyre	bubchi89: okay, clarify then
2013-11-05 21:12:18	bubchi89	if you have a degree, then you'll get a job
2013-11-05 21:12:20	bubchi89	where in that statement
2013-11-05 21:12:24	bubchi89	did i say it was a requirement to get a job?
2013-11-05 21:12:25	bubchi89	i didn't
2013-11-05 21:12:29	nisstyre	okay fair enough
2013-11-05 21:12:30	bubchi89	great. glad we agree on that
2013-11-05 21:12:44	bubchi89	my second statement is that, you can't just be "good" you have to do specific things
2013-11-05 21:12:57	bubchi89	you need to know people, or you need to go along some specific route to find employment

2013-11-05 21:14:35	nisstyre	bubchi89: probably because the other applicants sucked

2013-11-05 21:20:31	spjt	nisstyre: Interesting. I've noticed that self-taught programmers that are younger tend to have less of a concept of what is and isn't expensive.
2013-11-05 21:20:34	crystalgrystal	a comp sci degree in uni isn't essential to work in the industry

2013-11-05 21:22:11	spjt	nisstyre: The question is whether they can actually code the more efficient solution, which is more about experience than training
2013-11-05 21:22:35	nisstyre	spjt: it's not that useless to prove something is in a certain complexity class if you can figure it out with a less rigorous way
2013-11-05 21:22:43	nisstyre	really, although I suppose I could do that

2013-11-05 21:23:55	spjt	nisstyre: A lot of things should be obvious. I've seen otherwise pretty good self-taught programmers who didn't realize a function could call itself
2013-11-05 21:24:01	nisstyre	spjt: also sometimes things that look less efficient are actually faster in practice
2013-11-05 21:24:05	nisstyre	see: fibonnaci trees
2013-11-05 21:24:13	nisstyre	also it depends on the average input size
2013-11-05 21:24:37	nisstyre	if your average input size is small enough, than for example, linear search performs better than binary search
2013-11-05 21:24:38	spjt	A bubble sort is the fastest sort when the input is already sorted :)
2013-11-05 21:24:41	nisstyre	s/than/then/
2013-11-05 21:24:52	nisstyre	spjt: yeah exactly
2013-11-05 21:24:59	nisstyre	many people don't get that
2013-11-05 21:25:08	bubchi89	nah it isn't. my sort is faster
2013-11-05 21:25:11	nisstyre	even, and maybe especially CS undergrads
2013-11-05 21:25:13	bubchi89	it takes the input and just returns it
2013-11-05 21:25:15	bubchi89	it doesn't always work though
2013-11-05 21:25:29	spjt	bubchi89: That's pretty much what bubble sort does when the list is already sorted
2013-11-05 21:25:30	nisstyre	sleepsort is pretty awesome
2013-11-05 21:25:48	spjt	a bubble sort on an already sorted list will traverse the list once
2013-11-05 21:25:49	bubchi89	i think randsort is equivalent to my algorithm... but it always works
2013-11-05 21:25:56	nisstyre	quantum bogosort as well
2013-11-05 21:26:01	bubchi89	actually no
2013-11-05 21:26:04	bubchi89	randsort has to iterate over the array
2013-11-05 21:26:09	bubchi89	hmmm
2013-11-05 21:26:20	bubchi89	oh is it called bogosort
2013-11-05 21:26:21	nisstyre	spjt: anyway, I'll admit I have little experience with some formal mathematical arguments
2013-11-05 21:26:22	bubchi89	yeah it is lol
2013-11-05 21:26:31	nisstyre	but it's quite rare to employ them in practice
2013-11-05 21:26:36	spjt	any sort has a minimum O(n) because it has to at least traverse the list once to determine if it is sorted or not
2013-11-05 21:26:42	bubchi89	i actually really appreciate my math background
2013-11-05 21:26:42	nisstyre	although I see the value in understanding them
2013-11-05 21:26:46	bubchi89	it means that i can argue things precisely
2013-11-05 21:26:50	bubchi89	whereas my coworkers are really bad at that
2013-11-05 21:26:53	nisstyre	I do like and do math
2013-11-05 21:26:57	nisstyre	just not complexity theory
2013-11-05 21:27:05	nisstyre	but I get the basics, more or less
2013-11-05 21:27:07	bubchi89	if you haven't struggled with logic then you're probably not so great at it
2013-11-05 21:27:25	nisstyre	bubchi89: I'm pretty sure I get logic
2013-11-05 21:27:47	bubchi89	when you say you don't like compleixty theory
2013-11-05 21:27:47	bubchi89	do you mean you don't like doing runtime analysis
2013-11-05 21:27:47	bubchi89	or you don't like complexity theory

2013-11-05 21:33:58	nisstyre	you did do stuff like f(0) = 1, f(n) = 2 * f(n-1) though right?
2013-11-05 21:34:06	nisstyre	and learn how to find a closed form?

2013-11-05 21:34:15	bubchi89	they're used in other places in math
2013-11-05 21:34:16	spjt	nisstyre: well, maybe I did, some of that stuff looks familiar, finding closed forms of summations
2013-11-05 21:34:24	nisstyre	bubchi89: they aren't called generating functions though
2013-11-05 21:34:34	bubchi89	they were in my math courses...

2013-11-05 21:35:42	nisstyre	a sequence is a bunch of numbers

2013-11-05 21:38:04	bubchi89	i've had the floating notion that perhaps documentation in the code hsould be brief but there should also be some place with the full documentation
2013-11-05 21:38:12	bubchi89	where the coder can feel free to be as detailed as they want

2013-11-05 21:38:53	bubchi89	for example... any functions that are part of a language's standard usually have that sort of documentation
2013-11-05 21:38:59	bubchi89	sure

2013-11-05 21:41:06	spjt	the only documentation most things need, or should need is what the arguments are and what ti returns
2013-11-05 21:41:16	bubchi89	nisstyre: i imagine it's used in analysis a lot actually which i never took
2013-11-05 21:41:24	nisstyre	bubchi89: yeah, they get used there
2013-11-05 21:41:39	nisstyre	bubchi89: the guy who co-wrote CM with Knuth, Ronald Graham, is a famous combinatorics guy
2013-11-05 21:41:42	bubchi89	nisstyre: i think maybe the reason why knuth said that is because you never use generating functions as functions really. you manipulate the summation itself

2013-11-05 21:44:19	bubchi89	nisstyre: huh? generating functions are usually like literally normal functions that map from the real numbers to the real numbers
2013-11-05 21:44:36	bubchi89	nisstyre: but they need to be representable by some power series
2013-11-05 21:44:49	nisstyre	bubchi89: not sure what you mean
2013-11-05 21:44:51	bubchi89	nisstyre: yeah i like set theory a lot too. i thinkwe already talked about it
2013-11-05 21:45:10	nisstyre	what do you mean "normal functions" ?
2013-11-05 21:45:39	bubchi89	i mean ther'es nothing weird about it. it just takes a real number and maps it to another real number

2013-11-05 21:46:12	bubchi89	for instance G(x) = 1/(1-x) is a generating function which happens to be equal to 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...
2013-11-05 21:46:22	bubchi89	although maybe some people define the generating function to be the sequence of coefficients
2013-11-05 21:46:26	bubchi89	1 1 1 1 1. dunno
2013-11-05 21:46:31	spjt	jjb1231: It's not bad, maybe it just seems weird because python puts the doc comments after the function definition
2013-11-05 21:46:41	bubchi89	in which case you're right i guess and it maps the naturals to the set of coefficients

2013-11-05 21:51:18	nisstyre	bubchi89: even wikipedia says "Generating functions are not functions in the formal sense of a mapping from a domain to a codomain; the name is merely traditional, and they are sometimes more correctly called generating series.[2]"

2013-11-05 21:52:37	bubchi89	my best guess is that generating functions as defined don't have an actual domain
2013-11-05 21:52:52	nisstyre	well, like I said they're not formally defined as functions
2013-11-05 21:52:55	bubchi89	it's irrelevant what x is
2013-11-05 21:52:59	bubchi89	that's great nisstyre
2013-11-05 21:53:08	nisstyre	in order for something to be a function it must have a clearly defined domain which is (usually) a set
2013-11-05 21:53:25	nisstyre	and a co-domain, and some mapping between them
2013-11-05 21:54:46	nisstyre	it could be bijective, surjective, injective, etc...

2013-11-05 21:54:47	bubchi89	i mean the point is if you simply let the domain be the real numbers, generating functions would satisfy the definition of a function
2013-11-05 21:54:47	bubchi89	i guess the point is that they don't actually define the domain
2013-11-05 21:54:47	bubchi89	because it's irrelevant
2013-11-05 21:54:47	nisstyre	bijections are interesting because you can use them to do interesting stuff with infinite sets
2013-11-05 21:54:47	bubchi89	although it's interesting to think of closed forms if you don't have a domain
2013-11-05 21:54:54	nisstyre	if you can show a bijection between the natural numbers and some set, then it's "countable"
2013-11-05 21:55:03	bubchi89	yep
2013-11-05 21:55:11	bubchi89	i struggled with set theory at cmu for a semester
2013-11-05 21:55:29	bubchi89	probably my favorite non-programming course
2013-11-05 21:55:39	nisstyre	bubchi89: did you have to prove there is a bijection between Q and N?
2013-11-05 21:55:47	bubchi89	no it was one of the examples done in class
2013-11-05 21:55:56	nisstyre	still cool though
2013-11-05 21:55:58	bubchi89	we proved other similar things that were a bit more contrived
2013-11-05 21:56:15	nisstyre	there are ways to enumerate Q too
2013-11-05 21:56:24	nisstyre	(which you could use to prove the bijection I think)
2013-11-05 21:56:41	nisstyre	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence
2013-11-05 21:57:13	bubchi89	an injection from Q to N is trivial
2013-11-05 21:57:28	nisstyre	yeah good point
2013-11-05 21:57:38	bubchi89	you also know it's infinite
2013-11-05 21:57:51	bubchi89	and finally there's an axiom that omega is the least infinite ordinal
2013-11-05 21:57:56	nisstyre	you have to prove *every* element of both sets maps to only *one* element in the other
2013-11-05 21:57:58	bubchi89	so you could use that to prove its cardinality i think
2013-11-05 21:58:15	bubchi89	not with the outline i just suggested
2013-11-05 21:58:35	bubchi89	but that proof assumes that you have the lemma

2013-11-05 21:59:21	bubchi89	well i know the axiom of infinity declares omega to exist
2013-11-05 21:59:25	bubchi89	i guess it doesn't say it's the least such ordinal
2013-11-05 21:59:28	bubchi89	that must have been some other lemma
2013-11-05 21:59:30	bubchi89	lol
2013-11-05 21:59:34	bubchi89	that was the most ridiculous part of set theory
2013-11-05 21:59:38	bubchi89	where there were hundreds of little lemmas
2013-11-05 21:59:41	nisstyre	I would have to check a book to be sure
2013-11-05 21:59:51	nisstyre	and I don't have them with me atm
2013-11-05 21:59:56	bubchi89	and you could prove any claim 20 different ways if you proved the lemmas. but often there was an elegant way that avoided any of those lemmas
2013-11-05 22:00:01	bubchi89	and so you'd struggle to prove it exactly that way

2013-11-05 22:49:18	nisstyre	boxfish: all is basically and generalized to lists
2013-11-05 22:49:41	nisstyre	and map applies that function to both lists where each value of the lists are the arguments
2013-11-05 22:49:47	boxfish	Right
2013-11-05 22:49:53	nisstyre	a = value of thresh, b = value of a
2013-11-05 22:49:55	nisstyre	yeah you get it
2013-11-05 22:50:09	boxfish	Got any specific tips for someone who's coded exclusively in C and C++ and is learning Python?
