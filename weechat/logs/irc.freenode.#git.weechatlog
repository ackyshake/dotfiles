2013-11-04 21:23:05	Watabou	Hi. On the official github app for the Mac, I can select a commit two commits back and then select "rollback". What is the equivalent git command for this? Just git revert HEAD~2..HEAD ?
2013-11-04 21:24:01	Watabou	I see that the commit message from the official Github app is different from the git command I run on the terminal. The github app says "rollbacks to commit #blah" while the command line version says "this revert commit #blah"
2013-11-04 21:24:14	Watabou	Just wanted to know if there's any difference between the two.
2013-11-04 21:25:16	skorgon	!revert
2013-11-04 21:25:16	@gitinfo	That's a rather ambiguous question... options: a) make a commit that "undoes" the effects of an earlier commit [man git-revert]; b) discard uncommitted changes in the working tree [git reset --hard]; c) undo committing [git reset --soft HEAD^]; d) restore staged versions of files [git checkout -p]; e) move the current branch to a different point(possibly losing commits)[git reset --hard $COMMIT]?
2013-11-04 21:25:42	skorgon	i don't know what the github app does, but probably one of those things
2013-11-04 21:25:59	Watabou	I want to rollback to a previous commit, but not rewrite history. i.e. I don't want to reset

2013-11-04 21:26:50	skorgon	then probaly git checkout <commit> . && git commit
2013-11-04 21:26:53	Watabou	So is the correct command for rolling back three commits, lets say, is "git revert HEAD~3..HEAD"?

2013-11-04 21:27:35	skorgon	not sure what revert does with a range. might work
2013-11-04 21:28:46	Watabou	I got that one of the past stackoverflow answers. Not too sure how it works exactly though. I *think* it does what I want

2013-11-05 09:02:37	milki	thats how rebase works
2013-11-05 09:02:49	droogans	Ok good
2013-11-05 09:03:00	milki	droogans: !rewrite
2013-11-05 09:03:00	@gitinfo	droogans: [!rewriting_public_history] Rewriting public history is usually bad. Everyone who has pulled the old history have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push -f` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum
2013-11-05 09:03:01	osse	droogans: is it your own private branch? Are you sure you're rebasing the right way, ie. you rebase your branch on top of master and not the other way around?
2013-11-05 09:03:03	droogans	Was worried push -f was a red flag
2013-11-05 09:03:22	droogans	See, git infor hates force push lol

In the past, I've used static branches, but adhoc branches seem to be very popular with git, so I want to make sure I don't just do what I've done in the past without researching.

It's not too different from what I've done in the past, except that I've used a static "Test" branch in place of multiple "Release-*" branches, and one or more static "AdHoc" branch in place of multiple "Hotfix-*" branches.

2013-11-05 11:11:34	+dpomerantz	e.g. We have a DAL.  Some changes to the DAL would require every consuming application to be tested and re-deployed, but some changes do not.  We do not want to go through a test cycle for every application whenever there is a minor change, but we want to have a single production branch which holds "What's currently in production."

The two solutions I've come up with so far are 1) use tags to ensure that the correct "production version" is retrieved, or 2) have seperate "production branches" for each consuming application.

2013-11-05 18:32:39	Amadiro	deryni, should be the exact name of the file (well, it should be "DefaultCreateWindow.js".

2013-11-05 18:45:23	wagle	problem is that branch "wild-goose-chase" is a fork of branch "the-real-thing", and the two branches are following each other around, when "the-real-thing" should have been left behind

2013-11-05 18:48:47	deryni	Welcome.
2013-11-05 18:48:47	deryni	So what was the filename?
2013-11-05 18:48:47	wagle	I know what the star means, I dont understand why the two branches are tracking each other
2013-11-05 18:48:47	Amadiro	The file was indeed called exactly what I thought it was (and, as expected, withhin a gorillion nested subfolders), so don't know why the other query did not catch it
2013-11-05 18:48:47	imMute	wagle: are they both local branches? or is one of them a remote tracking branch?
2013-11-05 18:48:47	deryni	Odd.
2013-11-05 18:48:50	wagle	local branches
2013-11-05 18:48:52	deryni	wagle: Are they tracking? Does changing one change the other?
2013-11-05 18:48:58	sriracha	deryni: so there is no way to avoid this?
2013-11-05 18:49:38	deryni	sriracha: Look into whatever the recent git feature for submodule branch tracking is. Maybe it does what you want or maybe you don't want submodules at all.
2013-11-05 18:49:53	wagle	i created "wild-goose-chase", checked it out, and have been making commits exclusively to it

2013-11-05 21:03:26	milki	bitlee can connect to twitter just fine
2013-11-05 21:03:30	shoshin	hello, i'm facing a little problem. I made changes to file main.py and create a commit A. I then modified other files and created a new commit, B. I then realised that i made a mistake in my main.py commit, i made changes to the file and rebased it to commit B instead of commit A. How do i add the change in commit A instead of commit B?
2013-11-05 21:03:38	shoshin	i hope i was clear.
2013-11-05 21:03:45	shoshin	i tried the following.
2013-11-05 21:03:45	milki	shoshin: !fixup
2013-11-05 21:03:46	@gitinfo	shoshin: So you lost or broke something or need to otherwise find, fix, or delete commits? Look at http://sethrobertson.github.com/GitFixUm/ for full instructions, or !fixup_hints for the tl;dr. Warning: changing old commits will require you to !rewrite published history!

2013-11-05 21:05:09	shoshin	milki git checkout <bad-commit>  then git commit --amend -v, it opened up an editor with the code. how do i make modifications to this code? how do i remove the part of code that i don't want?
2013-11-05 21:05:19	shoshin	milki okay, will try it.

2013-11-05 21:06:20	shoshin	but isn't fixup for merging the contents of 2 commits into one?
2013-11-05 21:06:40	shoshin	i want to maintain them as separate commits. just shift the changes i made from commit A to commit B.
2013-11-05 21:08:06	milki	the fixup term in an interactive rebase is not what that link is

2013-11-05 22:13:08	apipkin	I thought I'd check here since there are many knowledgable people in here :) I'm trying to ping a domain from my server (where the domain is hosted) and I am getting an unknown host error. I changed the DNS earlier today. Is this just a result of the DNS having not been propagated yet, or is there something else wrong. Other domains on this server are able to be pinged.

2013-11-05 23:05:22	Fandekasp	I want to git subtree add a repo tag, but it fails. Seems to only work with branches, and I can't create a branch with the same name as the tag

2013-11-06 00:13:21	luckyruby	Hi, I'm looking for some advice on what to do if a series of commits were made by someone else in error. I made it worse by committing changes after the erroneous commits. What I would like is to rollback to the commit right before the first bad commit, then reapply all the later commits excluding the bad ones. Is that possible?

2013-11-06 18:17:25	steak	Yeah I think I need to investigate the shared storage idea further.
2013-11-06 18:17:53	ojacobson	sharing storage between a `git`-based server and gerrit is a non-starter
2013-11-06 18:18:05	ojacobson	gerrit (well, jgit) doesn't guarantee the same locking mechanisms, AFAIK
2013-11-06 18:18:19	ojacobson	you're going to have to solve this with meat, or with a sharp transition, I think
2013-11-06 18:18:36	jrnieder	I thought jgit did use the normal locking mechanism for ref updates
2013-11-06 18:18:41	steak	ojacobson: OK thanks, that's good to know.
2013-11-06 18:18:47	ojacobson	Could be
2013-11-06 18:18:51	jrnieder	but I agree that a sharp transition is nicest :)

2013-11-06 18:20:38	ojacobson	if nothing else, you can turn writes on one off and the other on at a well-announced time

2013-11-06 20:56:19	skorgon	well, to integrate changes into a branch you usually use merge, cherry-pick or am. and then you can publish the branch if you like. so, depending on your workflow and what you want to achieve, cherry-pick is probably the right tool

2013-11-06 20:59:56	d8bhatta	skorgon: thanks, i have to spend lots of time just resolve the conflicts that appears during cherry-pick of several commits...so probably i didn't care that which one is older and younger...so it looks like we need to cherry-pick from most recent commits to older commits...right?
2013-11-06 21:00:47	skorgon	rather from old to young. the younger should be based on older work, right?

2013-11-06 21:04:23	skorgon	did you already publish your changes and do you have downstream users? read !rewrite
2013-11-06 21:04:24	@gitinfo	[!rewriting_public_history] Rewriting public history is usually bad. Everyone who has pulled the old history have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push -f` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

2013-11-06 22:21:59	Lewoco	canoon, Yup. This seems to work (i.e. no errors): (cd ~/tmp/MyGitRepoClone; git fetch)
2013-11-06 22:22:01	canoon	Lewoco, oh unless it can't handle the ~
2013-11-06 22:22:16	Lewoco	canoon, ~ should get expanded by bash
2013-11-06 22:22:22	Lewoco	I don't think git will ever see it.
2013-11-06 22:22:25	WernerZA	canoon, I put that in because i got a problem previously where i tried to package too many files
2013-11-06 22:22:28	canoon	not if its in the middle of a argument
2013-11-06 22:22:52	Lewoco	canoon, Damn you're right!
2013-11-06 22:23:02	canoon	WernerZA, yeah it looks like git can't handle that many files on the command line though

2013-11-07 00:09:44	lb1a	d8bhatta, you commit a change that said, stop caring about these files. and that what git does. it removed them from the version control.
2013-11-07 00:09:47	Chais	can someone please help me. I just pulled the latest changes from remote but for some reasons they aren't applied locally
2013-11-07 00:09:51	canoon	d8bhatta, copy them to your dev server, a somewhat standard way is to commit .sample files
2013-11-07 00:09:54	iveqy	d8bhatta: you can use man git checkout to get an old version of those files, but since you deleted them, of course git won't show them

2013-11-07 00:28:07	@gitinfo	Chais: Users of centralized VCSes will need to unlearn a number of habits in order to learn git. Many commands, such as "checkout" and "revert" bear little in common to those holding the same name in other systems.

2013-11-07 00:30:05	iveqy	d8bhatta: let's just stick with !revert that commit. A checkout obviously just confuses you. You probably want to do a man git revert since a man git reset would result in !public history rewrite
2013-11-07 00:30:05	@gitinfo	d8bhatta: That's a rather ambiguous question... options: a) make a commit that "undoes" the effects of an earlier commit [man git-revert]; b) discard uncommitted changes in the working tree [git reset --hard]; c) undo committing [git reset --soft HEAD^]; d) restore staged versions of files [git checkout -p]; e) move the current branch to a different point(possibly losing commits)[git reset --hard $COMMIT]?
2013-11-07 00:30:05	@gitinfo	d8bhatta: [!rewriting_public_history] Rewriting public history is usually bad. Everyone who has pulled the old history have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push -f` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

2013-11-07 09:16:32	dropdrive	So I have read access to my coworker's collection of scripts, except that he refuses to version control.  Is there a way for me to use git to track his changes *without* making a copy of his tree?  For example, it's not enough to set GIT_DIR, which doesn't "pretend" that there is a work tree.

2013-11-07 10:52:49	+bamj0rb	dropdrive: Define "modify"? :-/ git-add and git-commit do modify the working directory. git-add adds changes to the index. git commit turns the index into a proper commit object.

2013-11-07 12:06:48	+halfdan	I'm trying to checkout an old branch "foo" - it fails because on master several directories were replaced by submodules and the checkout would override the files in the submodule directories. How can I checkout my old branch?

2013-11-07 12:57:55	+alphpt	hi. I'm using git version 1.8.4.msysgit.0 (windows). since this version I've been noticing weird behaviour in git rebase. seldom when rebasing a bunch of changes on top of another branch fails with merge conflicts, where merge conflicts were not expected. after `git rebase --abort` and `git rebase` once again, it succeeeds. is this issue known?

2013-11-07 13:13:08	Snibble	git mv instead of mv?

2013-11-09 20:50:44	covi	Hi guys.  When I am using git rebase and squash a bunch of commits to the earliest commit in the series, the resulting  squashed commit has commit date set at the earliest. So although the history now looks linear, the date is out of order.  Is this common / unavoidable?

2013-11-09 22:08:07	AlecTaylor	I am planning to write a simple git+scripts daemon to listen for repository changes; then run some scripts [which will include a `git pull`]. Is there a good one I can use already?

2013-11-09 22:29:25	noobee	shas that i want to remove or preserve?
2013-11-09 22:29:47	milki	no, the grafts you are defining
2013-11-09 22:29:50	milki	do you know what a graft is?
2013-11-09 22:29:52	noobee	what i want to do is to move a branch to another repository
2013-11-09 22:30:01	milki	thats not a graft -.-
2013-11-09 22:30:24	noobee	but only from the commit where that branch is started
2013-11-09 22:30:46	noobee	i dont want the commits before that
2013-11-09 22:30:55	milki	is this going to be an orphaned branch in the new repo then?
2013-11-09 22:31:06	noobee	yes
2013-11-09 22:31:14	noobee	the branch starts empty
2013-11-09 22:31:22	milki	then you need to create a new orphaned branch
2013-11-09 22:31:31	milki	commit the tree from where the branch started
2013-11-09 22:31:38	noobee	like the first commit of that branch is removing all files
2013-11-09 22:31:44	milki	and move the history overwith cherry-pick or rebase
2013-11-09 22:31:52	milki	and then push the branch to the repo
2013-11-09 22:32:01	milki	any other variations should work fine

2013-11-09 22:35:22	milki	grafts are local y the repo only so it wont really help you "move" the branch to another repo

2013-11-09 22:35:22	milki	oo, thats a smart way of truncating history
2013-11-09 22:35:22	milki	thats pretty cool
2013-11-09 22:35:22	milki	didnt know filter-branch would work that way
2013-11-09 22:35:22	noobee	but i dont really understand
2013-11-09 22:35:22	noobee	your way is easier to understand
2013-11-09 22:35:22	milki	well filter-branch is complicated, but it truncates history
2013-11-09 22:35:35	milki	if you clone your repo and truncate it
2013-11-09 22:35:45	milki	then thats effectively moving the branch to the new clone
2013-11-09 22:35:54	noobee	the reason why i want to remove old history is that i messed up pretty bad in that histories
2013-11-09 22:35:59	milki	that makes it pretty easy
2013-11-09 22:36:17	noobee	so when i clone it it takes a long time cos in the old history it has so many binary files like images n stuffs
2013-11-09 22:36:25	milki	if you are removing old history, then i would recommend the filter-branch method
2013-11-09 22:36:44	noobee	removing old history only for that branch but not the master
2013-11-09 22:37:11	noobee	is this filter branch the way of doing it?
2013-11-09 22:37:21	milki	if its just one branch, truncating wont help unless its the only branch in the new repo
2013-11-09 22:38:23	noobee	if i can have a branch without that old history then i wont need to have a new repo
2013-11-09 22:38:26	milki	yes, filter-branch is the recommended way for modifying really old history

2013-11-09 22:39:17	noobee	so it this filter-branch related to git graft?
2013-11-09 22:39:46	milki	no, but the method described makes it easier to truncate past a specific commit rather than trying to give it options
2013-11-09 22:39:58	milki	ive never seen it used that way though
2013-11-09 22:40:44	noobee	so why is the answer mentioning git graft

2013-11-09 22:44:50	noobee	like what first commit will i have in the filter-branch?

2013-11-10 00:56:40	silviof	Someone from the mailling list here? I have written this patch http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/237572 and ask for assistance to work on this issue ... I think it is no good perl-style (I'm newbie with perl), but I will work on this issue. I need some hints. Someone can review my patch?

2013-11-10 14:27:47	Dougie187	Is there a good reason to use a `git subtree` rather than a `git submodule -b`?

2013-11-10 14:29:09	Hello71	!subtree
2013-11-10 14:29:09	@gitinfo	The subtree merge method is great for incorporating a subsidiary git repo into your current one with "unified" history. Read http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Subtree-Merging for more info, or try one of the !subtree_alternatives
2013-11-10 14:29:14	Hello71	!subtree_alternatives
2013-11-10 14:29:15	@gitinfo	[!subtree_alt] The git subtree merge method is hard to export changes from..  https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree provides another method which appears to be easier to export changes from.  Also as a no-change-exported method, see https://metacpan.org/module/git-stitch-repo which claims to generate a unified history instead of merged branches.

2013-11-10 14:30:02	Hello71	I think git submodule -b selects the branch of the repo
2013-11-10 14:30:15	Dougie187	It does
2013-11-10 14:30:35	Dougie187	It sets the submodule up to track a specific branch of a repo.

2013-11-10 14:31:24	Dougie187	So, then if you want to track the repo/branch, you have to "re-merge" that tree into your working repo
2013-11-10 14:31:26	Dougie187	right?

2013-11-10 15:05:18	heftig	one way i thought of would be to cherry-pick everything up to the merge, then do the merge again with --squash, and then pick the rest of the commits
