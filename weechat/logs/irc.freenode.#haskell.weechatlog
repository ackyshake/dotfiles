2013-11-09 20:46:12	unbirthday	hello, can someone help me with SDL-image, I keep getting the same error in almost everything (my own code and from hackage). I get "Couldn't match expected type `SurfaceStruct'" when using loadTyped or load. I tried an older version of SDL, but it wouldn't compile :/

2013-11-09 20:47:20	unbirthday	I checked the sources, and load/loadType in the newer SDL-image uses IO Surface, instead of just Surface ~ what can I do?
2013-11-09 20:47:50	unbirthday	sorry, I mean it doesn't use IO Surface

2013-11-09 21:46:56	unbirthday	dwcook: come back please
2013-11-09 21:46:58	solrize	what is the application?
2013-11-09 21:46:59	solrize	you should avoid keyless hashes if you can help it
2013-11-09 21:47:01	joelteon	so newStdGen?
2013-11-09 21:47:28	solrize	i dunno if there's an instance for urandom... just read some bytes from it

2013-11-09 21:51:39	joelteon	how should I read N bytes from /urandom then

2013-11-09 21:52:04	Kron	you can just read from it after opening it like a file, I think
2013-11-09 21:52:15	Kron	it's basically an infinite stream of random stuff
2013-11-09 21:52:26	joelteon	yeah, but I want to read a specific number of bytes
2013-11-09 21:52:36	joelteon	and I don't see how to do that
2013-11-09 21:52:37	Kron	(by opening it like a file I mean opening up a stream in a programming language, not opening it in your friendly neighbourhood text editor)
2013-11-09 21:52:41	unbirthday	dwcook: http://lpaste.net/7383758654018682880
2013-11-09 21:52:46	joelteon	yeah, i know.
2013-11-09 21:52:52	solrize	joelton:   just open the file and use hGetChar
2013-11-09 21:52:53	joelteon	i'm saying, how do I read N bytes from a handle in binary mode.
2013-11-09 21:52:55	Kron	you can open it in a given program and just read N bytes from the stream
2013-11-09 21:53:05	Kron	hGetCar of scanf or (read)
2013-11-09 21:53:07	joelteon	is there not a function for this?
2013-11-09 21:53:10	Kron	depends on your language
2013-11-09 21:53:14	joelteon	haskell
2013-11-09 21:53:14	Kron	ah
2013-11-09 21:53:19	Kron	I get hGetChar
2013-11-09 21:53:22	Kron	*I think
2013-11-09 21:53:24	dwcook	unbirthday, what's the specific issue?
2013-11-09 21:53:34	solrize	withBinaryFile "/dev/urandom" ReadMode $ bytes <- replicateM nbytes . hGetChar
2013-11-09 21:53:41	joelteon	replicateM
2013-11-09 21:53:43	joelteon	that makes sense
2013-11-09 21:53:50	solrize	withBinaryFile "/dev/urandom" ReadMode $  replicateM nbytes . hGetChar
2013-11-09 21:53:55	solrize	something like that
2013-11-09 21:54:35	solrize	you could use bytestrings and Data.Binary.Get if you need a lot of them

2013-11-10 02:08:47	Iceland_jack	The reason for run* being wrong is that the state you're passing in is generally small while the monadic value is generally rather big

2013-11-10 12:07:53	alexander__b	I see RWH calls value assignment "variables", and even goes to say that a *variable* may *never change* (lol). is this common? do people call things variables in haskell? I never imagined, and have said (on several occasions) said that haskell doesn't have variables.

2013-11-10 12:08:32	gfredericks	the return trick worked
2013-11-10 12:08:36	gfredericks	I'll just stick with that

2013-11-10 15:02:11	FreeFull	Scalaz has something that looks like monads
2013-11-10 15:02:12	Hafydd	Monad is in the standard library. Is that not foundational enough?

2013-11-10 15:02:22	Iceland_jack	Hafydd: That is not my point
2013-11-10 15:02:26	Hafydd	Also, you need to use Monad to write literally any useful program.

2013-11-10 15:02:39	Cale	(But in any case, you'll need *some* foundations!)
2013-11-10 15:02:41	Iceland_jack	Using monads and “I want to learn monads” are completely separate things
2013-11-10 15:02:44	moops	you can do it with typeclasses
2013-11-10 15:02:58	Hafydd	I disagree. You can't use something properly without knowing what it is.

2013-11-10 16:19:57	Rand_McNally	I have defined a custom function, "distintos", that checks if each element is unique.
2013-11-10 16:20:21	Rand_McNally	It's awfully ugly, but seems to work.

2013-11-10 16:21:19	Rand_McNally	Of course, arkeet. :)

2013-11-10 16:22:06	Rand_McNally	distontos means something like "dis-fools"
2013-11-10 16:22:10	arkeet	haha.
2013-11-10 16:22:23	Rand_McNally	...beautiful, btw.
2013-11-10 16:22:34	jedai	Rand_McNally: because you don't need to check previous elements, if they were identical, you would already have caught it, arkeet solution take advantage of this

2013-11-10 17:01:12	jedai	Fact is both terminologies are currently present and so you get large discrepancies between programs/description/ ... (though if it's an ad, you can be sure they're using the new definition, they must really like the SI...)

2013-11-10 17:02:22	Eduard_Munteanu	Is Alex still a reasonable option these days for parsing? I find (atto)parsec's non-layered approach a bit disturbing.
2013-11-10 17:02:25	Narvius	Sounds somewhat like what I want.
2013-11-10 17:02:35	monochrom	however, I prefer Fokkinga's "a gentle introduction to category theory"

2013-11-10 17:03:58	Eduard_Munteanu	mzero: well, I was admittedly going for attoparsec. But even Parsec seems to have that tokenizer generator as sort of a 2nd class citizen.
2013-11-10 17:03:59	mzero	The most recent release GHC: 7.6.3
2013-11-10 17:04:11	mm_freak	Eduard_Munteanu: you can have shorter grammar descriptions and encode some grammatical features more easily (like left-recursive grammars), but it's not a combinator approach, so you don't get first class parsers
2013-11-10 17:04:20	mzero	no no - I mean just write your own tokenizer - often easier!
2013-11-10 17:04:23	monochrom	I have an example of what you do with [Token]. http://www.vex.net/~trebla/haskell/parsec-generally.xhtml
2013-11-10 17:04:25	general-general	OK, jedai, I suppose I'm curious as to how this 'difference' is one that helps (or perhaps hinders, although I'm guessing no one will say it hinders) anyone who is programming stuff that is regex intensive.
2013-11-10 17:04:46	mm_freak	Eduard_Munteanu: and yes, what mzero said
2013-11-10 17:04:54	monochrom	I just don't have an example of how to produce that [Token]
2013-11-10 17:04:58	Eduard_Munteanu	Hm, so two passes with attoparsec would be fine.
2013-11-10 17:05:03	jdhutah	Narvius: I kinda like CT for Scientists also, by David Spivak (not the famous Spivak). http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s996-category-theory-for-scientists-spring-2013/textbook/
2013-11-10 17:05:25	mm_freak	Eduard_Munteanu: depending on the complexity of your grammar the first pass may not actually be an attoparsec pass
2013-11-10 17:05:30	general-general	&/or any other aspect of Haskell that makes regex using Haskell 'the thing to do' if you are willing to develop in Haskell.
2013-11-10 17:05:30	Narvius	Reading Fokkinga now. :S
2013-11-10 17:05:32	Rand_McNally	How would you define a function that gets the first common element of two ordered lists?
2013-11-10 17:05:37	Rand_McNally	My try at it was...
2013-11-10 17:05:39	jedai	general-general: if you're restricting yourself to regex, you probably don't want to use Haskell... Though you may gain much by using real parsers instead and Haskell is among the best to write those
2013-11-10 17:05:42	Eduard_Munteanu	mm_freak: yeah, it could just be 'words'
2013-11-10 17:05:43	Rand_McNally	Please don't laugh at me.
2013-11-10 17:05:49	mzero	well, two passes with attoparsec isn't really feasible - it is only over ByteString
2013-11-10 17:06:05	mzero	attoparsec is mostly good for parsing wire- and disk- formats
2013-11-10 17:06:07	Rand_McNally	firstCom xs ys =  head $ head $ filter (not.null)[[x|x<-xs, x<=y, elem x ys]|y<-ys]

2013-11-10 17:17:55	Eduard_Munteanu	alexander__b: gtk2hs isn't very complex, though not light either I guess
2013-11-10 17:17:57	mm_freak	well, not quite
2013-11-10 17:18:06	mm_freak	alexander__b: my favorite GUI library is happstack =)
2013-11-10 17:18:06	hpc	it's a sad day when the lightest GUI library one can think of is gecko
2013-11-10 17:18:13	mzero	doesn't say "first common element of two monotonically increasing lists"
2013-11-10 17:18:23	alexander__b	I am going to do this project to learn how to do... more advanced stuff, for the record. this is just to get a feel for gui programming with haskell.
2013-11-10 17:18:24	Rand_McNally	It's implicit, since I'm using it to compute the lcm.
2013-11-10 17:18:34	alexander__b	I should also not that I'd love something that's declarative in the large not in the small
2013-11-10 17:18:43	jedai	mzero: but he said "define a function that gets the first common element of two ordered lists"

2013-11-10 17:20:34	mm_freak	for widget-based see reactive-banana or combine sodium with one of the GUI bindings

2013-11-10 17:24:57	alexander__b	mm_freak: I have written one in Python in very few lines. that was quite trivial. IDR what GUI I used though.
2013-11-10 17:25:01	mm_freak	there is no "general purpose" FRP implementation
2013-11-10 17:25:11	Eduard_Munteanu	alexander__b: if you can call external commands to create the UI, e.g. like dialog stuff, I wouldn't exclude that either
2013-11-10 17:25:29	mm_freak	simply because different applications need entirely different approaches…  in fact you can combine the FRP frameworks

2013-11-10 17:41:40	Eduard_Munteanu	mangaba_leitosa: just make sure you're using Data.Map.Strict, not the ordinary one
2013-11-10 17:41:42	mm_freak	so please stop saying "FRP" just because you react automatically to value changes! ;)
2013-11-10 17:41:44	alexander__b	maybe the thesis can be on something like FRP for this high-level language. like how an actor's dialogue options may be expressed via frp, or whether it's walking around or just standing, etc.
2013-11-10 17:41:46	amalloy	himh: i'm still a beginner, but i've defined a few monoid instances. generally when i'm like "okay i want to add an X to this other X. i could define a custom function for this, but if i make it a monoid instead it'll be a little more flexible later on"
2013-11-10 17:42:05	Eduard_Munteanu	mangaba_leitosa: because ordinary numeric types are strict
2013-11-10 17:42:05	mangaba_leitosa	Eduard_Munteanu: I tried both Data.Map.Strict and Data.Map.Lazy, no difference
2013-11-10 17:42:25	conal	sadly "FRP" has come to be used for any vaguely "functional" approach to reactive programs.

2013-11-10 17:42:56	alexander__b	conal: the way I see FRP (being a newbie) is declarative event handling as opposed to "event listeners" and callback crap.
2013-11-10 17:43:06	alexander__b	+ reacting of course
2013-11-10 17:43:08	jedai	himh: Monoid are neat, so often you come across a type in some library and you remark that two values may be combined... and you check and there's a Monoid instance for the type ! which mean you have access to all the good stuff on Monoid (+ some of the Foldable/Traversable/Lens stuff that use Monoid)
2013-11-10 17:43:13	pharaun	does the frp ones out there still have what its named - time leaks?

2013-11-10 17:48:25	Eduard_Munteanu	mangaba_leitosa: with what sort of data? If your input was a String, then you might still be bottlenecked by that.
2013-11-10 17:48:27	Narvius	Hey, cool. Ordering has a monoid instance.
2013-11-10 17:49:00	hpc	(->) also has a Monoid instance sometimes

2013-11-10 18:09:31	mm_freak	conal: minus the typo that should work, doesn't it?  it's a variant of FRP that strictly disallows continuous functions
2013-11-10 18:09:47	Eduard_Munteanu	I think the lists are generating a lot of garbage.
2013-11-10 18:10:56	Eduard_Munteanu	Not only because they're lists, but because Prelude stuff generally doesn't fuse away.

2013-11-10 18:50:16	Eduard_Munteanu	And the normal data dependencies aren't there because IO calls are opaque. GHC could sequence a chain of actions by their result, but IO actions have side-effects too, so putStrLn :: IO () would escape that analysis.
2013-11-10 18:50:32	augur_	geekosaur: rough expansion on that?
2013-11-10 18:50:36	Eduard_Munteanu	Er, putStrLn something.
2013-11-10 18:50:38	geekosaur	um?
2013-11-10 18:50:47	geekosaur	what kind of expansion? do you want to know how the FFI works now?
2013-11-10 18:51:03	augur_	geekosaur: i want to know how an IO action translates into an FFI call

2013-11-10 18:51:49	geekosaur	it's not a compiler builtin though, there is for example a library which handles matters of encoding, buffering, and such
2013-11-10 18:52:01	geekosaur	think of it as C's stdio but written in and for Haskell

2013-11-10 18:52:27	Eduard_Munteanu	I think GHC.Prim stuff and the likes get referred to by name, and the compiler translates them to calls.

2013-11-10 18:54:00	geekosaur	(some of this can be quite simple, but generally the standard library provides a bunch of friendlier and relatively system independent wrappers for calls which may be quite different between (say) Windows and Linux)

2013-11-10 18:55:03	Eduard_Munteanu	In fact, I remember seeing them as    somePrimOp :: ...; somePrimOp = undefined
2013-11-10 18:55:17	geekosaur	yes, but I/O isn't done via primops
2013-11-10 18:55:26	Eduard_Munteanu	Ah.
2013-11-10 18:56:05	geekosaur	primops implement things like Word# and Int#, making them available to be wrapped into Haskell types
2013-11-10 18:56:08	geekosaur	@src Int
2013-11-10 18:56:09	lambdabot	data Int = I# Int#
2013-11-10 18:56:29	geekosaur	Int# there is implemented via primops
2013-11-10 18:56:34	Eduard_Munteanu	geekosaur: so it's just ordinary FFI calls for IO? Or do they use a different mechanism?
2013-11-10 18:56:40	geekosaur	ordinary FFI calls
2013-11-10 18:57:00	Eduard_Munteanu	Hm, cool.
2013-11-10 18:57:11	geekosaur	of course the FFI mechanism uses primops to the extent that the types expected by foreign functions are primitive types
2013-11-10 18:58:16	>	maxiepoo (~Max@c-24-13-81-249.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #haskell
2013-11-10 18:58:36	geekosaur	but, since the stuff in IO is about communicating with the system, ultimately it has to involve system calls --- and rather than try to keep track of how e.g. Linux changes kernel interfaces when glibc already does so, ghc just FFIs to the glibc functions

2013-11-10 18:59:47	geekosaur	if ghc were to try to make system calls directly, *that* would have to be a primop. but it'd also be nightmarish to maintain; linux kernel interfaces change all the time.

2013-11-10 19:01:14	Eduard_Munteanu	geekosaur: the syscalls are sort of stable, but glibc also tries to take advantage of the "good" ones too, AFAIK.
2013-11-10 19:01:35	Eduard_Munteanu	e.g. it can splice data instead of writing to a pipe.
2013-11-10 19:01:35	geekosaur	"sort of". I think stat() is still quite the mess...
2013-11-10 19:02:24	geekosaur	but in any case it's far better to defer all that stuff to glibc's stable interfaces and not worry about what goes on beyond that
2013-11-10 19:02:40	<	fronx (~fronx@g224250252.adsl.alicedsl.de) has quit (Read error: Operation timed out)
2013-11-10 19:03:07	Eduard_Munteanu	geekosaur: yeah... though I suppose that's just for IO purposes, since stuff like memcpy() are best left to a compiler even in C.
2013-11-10 19:03:17	geekosaur	yes

2013-11-10 19:04:07	geekosaur	although even there it would be possible to push memcpy() to LLVM (I don't know if the LLVM backend takes advantage of this though)

2013-11-10 21:17:30	Cirdec	So, the question could also probably be, what is the typeclass equivalent of Rank2Types/RankNTypes?
2013-11-10 21:18:10	edwardk	typeclasses are effectively already using rank-2
2013-11-10 21:18:48	edwardk	thats kind of how folks figured out rank-2 types were interesting in haskell, since they had to write something like them to desugar dictionaries anyways

2013-11-10 22:22:08	Kneiva	this is also interesting: show ((1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) :: (Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, ...

2013-11-10 22:23:45	dmwit	joeyh_: Try let f = join (,) in tail . f . f . f $ 1. Add f a few times.
2013-11-10 22:23:55	dmwit	See if you can spot the pattern, then compute how big the error would be for 256 chars.
2013-11-10 22:25:37	pavonia	it's always the same error message for me
2013-11-10 22:25:49	dmwit	Well.

2013-11-10 22:26:01	 *	joeyh_ is pretty sure the error message for 256 chars is "out of memory" :)
2013-11-10 22:26:07	dmwit	yeah =)
2013-11-10 22:26:40	pavonia	dmwit: no difference
2013-11-10 22:26:46	dmwit	pavonia: hm?
2013-11-10 22:26:46	joeyh_	clearly ghc needs lazy error message display
2013-11-10 22:26:49	dmwit	pavonia: What error do you get?
2013-11-10 22:27:00	dmwit	pavonia: When I try, I get wildly long messages after adding only a few 'f's.
2013-11-10 22:27:10	pavonia	"Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: a = (a, a)" + 4 extra lines
2013-11-10 22:27:22	enthropy	might be no Monad ((->) r) instance in scope
2013-11-10 22:27:41	dmwit	pavonia: It is important that you use let in exactly the way I said.
2013-11-10 22:27:45	pavonia	Ah, that's it :)
