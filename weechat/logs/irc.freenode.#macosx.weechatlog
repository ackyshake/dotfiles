2013-11-04 22:18:22	IamKing	JeffH:  I have yet to find a local mail client that can interface well with Gmail's special email properties, so I just use Gmail's web interface like Gorroth as well  --->  http://www.macworld.com/article/2059230/why-and-how-im-saying-goodbye-to-gmail.html
2013-11-04 22:21:03	JeffH	IamKing: thanks.  I think I'm coming to that same conclusion.  Fortunately I don't check my mail on my Mac often.

2013-11-04 22:22:28	IamKing	well, considering I have always checked my email via Gmail's web site for the past decade, I do not see the problem of sticking to that (unless you are hoping to leverage notifications in Mail.app or whatever local client you would end up using)

2013-11-05 11:31:51	+CoreInfo	i heard osxvnc is a third party VNC server for OSX. It offers the ability to have your own login session (much like VNC on X11), rather than only accessing whatever is displayed at the console, as the built-in Apple VNC server does. supports SSH tunneling, or http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxvnc/

2013-11-05 11:34:05	@rorx	and actually the advantage mentioned in the factoid is no longer the case with the AppleVNC server since 10.6 I think, which does let you login using a different account than what is being used on the console.

2013-11-05 18:33:50	nprice	Is anyone else having issues with the DHCP client in 10.9?  I was using the first Golden Master from ADC, but when I reinstalled with the official release, whenever I connect to a wireless network, it associates, but DHCP always times out, and I have to manually set an address.  I have confirmed that DHCP is working on the networks that I've tried thus far.

2013-11-05 20:55:04	jmgk	Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer believes the computer giant has to reinvent itself to avoid being "old and tired" as his company struggles to keep up in the mobile devices sector.
2013-11-05 20:55:05	jmgk	"We're finding ourselves having to start up again," Mr Ballmer said at a conference in Rome, where he announced Italy had become the first country in which Microsoft phones were outselling iPhones.
2013-11-05 20:55:05	jmgk	"Unless you're constantly inventing something new, you're old and tired. Today we're having to remake ourselves," Mr Ballmer told his audience.
2013-11-05 20:55:06	jmgk	Referring to the success of Microsoft against rival Apple's iPhone in Italy, he quipped: "I don't know how long it's going to last."

The error: "Project /Users/wolfman2000/Games/SM5/Xcode/stepmania_xcode4.3.xcodeproj cannot be opened because the project file cannot be parsed."  Is there a way to have this file be opened in both?

2013-11-06 22:01:51	Watabou	I'm pretty pleased at how quiet this thing runs
2013-11-06 22:01:58	Watabou	I have the 15-inch model.

2013-11-06 22:06:27	Watabou	Yeah I haven't noticed the fan go on except gaming. And even then, they're super quiet compared to my old 2008 MBP.
2013-11-06 22:06:55	maya-	Watabou, what are you using to show that?
2013-11-06 22:07:09	Watabou	Alfred :)

2013-11-06 22:07:35	Watabou	I love the workflows. The powerpack is worth it just for that

2013-11-06 22:15:38	evilbug	i guess it's all the underdeveloped gl stuff.

2013-11-06 22:37:21	evilbug	unicum: just export the db and since the wp install is local you already have it.

2013-11-06 22:39:18	Davey	note to self: don't accidentally transfer a file that is 30% of the size of your disk onto it :P
2013-11-06 22:39:26	evilbug	unicum: so just have your exported sql, import that into whatever server, then upload your wp folder and simply change the mysql in wp-config.
2013-11-06 22:39:31	evilbug	unicum: simple as that.

2013-11-07 12:07:31	D[4]ni	My source is packed with stuff like $(this.parentNode)
2013-11-07 12:07:44	rideh	but angular.js looks to be pretty thorough and well thoughtout.  my big problems are management of complicated sites. How do you organize all that code so it doesnt turn into spagehetti and you keep stuff dry?
2013-11-07 12:07:54	D[4]ni	instead of $(this).parent() as the average jQuery user would write it
2013-11-07 12:08:16	rideh	the component nature of angular is i think a step beyond traditional oops and benefitical for web type stuff

2013-11-07 12:10:13	rideh	jp-: well for performance reasons there is a lot of stuff jquery does that is really only saving youa  few keystrokes

2013-11-07 12:10:53	D[4]ni	IMO that stuff right there is pretty hard to style correctly.
2013-11-07 12:11:24	jp-	D[4]ni, they've made it harder in the documentation, in the past jquery-ui's markup and classes were well documented
2013-11-07 12:11:36	D[4]ni	If you only need a date picker, including jQuery UI seems like a waste.
2013-11-07 12:11:42	jp-	it's a recent thing that they have made it harder to find out the structure of widgets and what not.
2013-11-07 12:11:56	D[4]ni	And yeah, I know that you can only pick "date picker" and build your own "small" version of jQuery UI.

2013-11-07 12:13:01	rideh	D[4]ni: here's my take on that thogh - now you have all these different interpretations and codes that do the same thing but are repeated because everything you include simply named it different and rewrote it

2013-11-07 12:14:37	rideh	and i'm sure if you  have a date picker you have plenty of other code that needs to do calcuations with a calendar

Vomit on your clothes. Defecate and urinate in your pants. Then let the officers know what you've done. If they arrest you anyway, you'll get cleaned and reclothed at the jail.

2013-11-07 23:21:07	ryao	The mentality "lets disable security features to improve performance" reminds me of the guys that decided to run Google's internal network unencrypted. It definitely performed better.
2013-11-07 23:21:45	jalcine	lol
2013-11-07 23:21:52	jalcine	it's more RAM open

2013-11-07 23:22:48	ryao	jalcine: These days, there are encryption accelerators.
2013-11-07 23:23:02	ryao	xys_: And yet, they ran their internal network without it.

2013-11-09 16:19:40	itadder	my boss at that job over taxed the server
2013-11-09 16:19:48	itadder	he charged a fee per mailbox
2013-11-09 16:20:11	itadder	HE had no clue how to run exchange, so kept alt-n, plus I think he got resaller fee
2013-11-09 16:20:23	GeekDrew	lol
2013-11-09 16:20:28	itadder	only one two clients we moved to exchange
2013-11-09 16:20:33	itadder	2003
2013-11-09 16:20:37	itadder	badly run
2013-11-09 16:20:38	GeekDrew	were the mailboxes relatively low use?
2013-11-09 16:20:44	itadder	becuase they wanted blackberrys bes
2013-11-09 16:20:44	GeekDrew	i can't fathom running that many mailboxes on mdaemon
2013-11-09 16:20:46	GeekDrew	holy crap
2013-11-09 16:20:56	itadder	but they ran with alt-n for years
2013-11-09 16:21:04	itadder	until people wanted blackberries
2013-11-09 16:21:07	itadder	GeekDrew:  it was bad
2013-11-09 16:21:13	itadder	GeekDrew:  it would go do wn every sunday
2013-11-09 16:21:23	itadder	I would get calls mid monday morning it was down again
2013-11-09 16:21:30	itadder	high cpu and memory spike
2013-11-09 16:21:40	itadder	also it had the worst antispam features antivirus 
2013-11-09 16:21:45	itadder	it would let so much virus via email
2013-11-09 16:22:06	itadder	I told my boss at the time, why not just get hosted email services 
2013-11-09 16:22:14	itadder	that allow resall
2013-11-09 16:22:19	itadder	resell
2013-11-09 16:22:28	itadder	like intermedia and no downtown, but he said NO 
2013-11-09 16:22:39	itadder	He said alt-n works, just run lateset patch

2013-11-09 16:23:09	itadder	Becuase he did not know how to run exchange, and realy only new about alt-n, plus he loved eduroa
2013-11-09 16:23:25	itadder	he had most clients using world client, and a certain few on eduroa
2013-11-09 16:23:32	itadder	World Client is the worst webmail I ever used
2013-11-09 16:23:36	itadder	well the third worst
2013-11-09 16:23:50	GeekDrew	i'm surprised that the clients didn't call for his head on a pike
2013-11-09 16:24:01	itadder	before my college move to gmail apps, they h ad thier  own version pine webmail it was horrible
2013-11-09 16:24:09	itadder	GeekDrew:  yea I not sure why
2013-11-09 16:24:13	GeekDrew	ah haha
2013-11-09 16:24:16	itadder	maybe they did know now any better
2013-11-09 16:24:25	GeekDrew	i used to love pine mail client, text only
2013-11-09 16:24:27	itadder	did you use the plugin for outlook in alt0n
2013-11-09 16:24:38	GeekDrew	yes, for some mailboxes - not all
2013-11-09 16:24:39	itadder	it was not free
2013-11-09 16:24:46	itadder	I forget a lot about that
2013-11-09 16:24:47	GeekDrew	right

2013-11-09 16:25:34	itadder	so most of your mailboxes were pure world client
2013-11-09 16:25:51	GeekDrew	yeah i saw the link
2013-11-09 16:25:51	itadder	oh and most of the client who did use eduora were on POP
2013-11-09 16:25:54	itadder	not even IMAP

2013-11-09 16:26:05	itadder	until my boss one day got a android or a palm web os
2013-11-09 16:26:10	itadder	that he figured about imap
2013-11-09 16:26:14	GeekDrew	that explains how you got so many more clients to function
2013-11-09 16:26:19	itadder	He like wow, it keeps all my world client folders
2013-11-09 16:26:23	GeekDrew	worldclient used FAR fewer resources than POP, which used fewer than IMAP
2013-11-09 16:26:31	itadder	my boss used world client becuase he would hop on any client PC and use worldclient
2013-11-09 16:26:48	itadder	GeekDrew:  maybe that why he kept saying to me tell them to use world client
2013-11-09 16:26:50	GeekDrew	we probably had 200 or so Outlook Connector users, and the rest were Outlook using either POP or IMAP
2013-11-09 16:27:01	itadder	yea but not good when client says
2013-11-09 16:27:01	itadder	to me
2013-11-09 16:27:05	GeekDrew	yeah, if they used worldclient, he would be able to keep more mailboxes functioning at once
2013-11-09 16:27:15	itadder	why can't I right click this excel file and send to email

2013-11-09 16:27:53	itadder	they are like it slows me down I can't just attach a email with right click
2013-11-09 16:28:11	itadder	but yea most of the desktop client were POP
2013-11-09 16:28:23	itadder	he had no clue about imap until one day he got a new smartphone
2013-11-09 16:28:35	itadder	He like wow it sees my world client folders

2013-11-09 16:29:23	GeekDrew	huge pain in the ass, because my boss wouldn't let me automate it
2013-11-09 16:29:43	itadder	acutally eduora was good for pop
2013-11-09 16:29:53	itadder	Oh I recall also reason we finally were going off pop
2013-11-09 16:30:04	GeekDrew	he made us go to each end user's outlook installation, and export their mailbox to a PST, and then import that into exchange
2013-11-09 16:30:06	itadder	he would get error message from his top client who used eudora
2013-11-09 16:30:15	itadder	he would get failed logoins in eduora
2013-11-09 16:30:23	itadder	becase his blackberry and pop would cause issues
2013-11-09 16:30:46	GeekDrew	lol
2013-11-09 16:30:47	itadder	alt-n did not like mutiple logins to pop and sometimes email would pop to eudora and not show up in blackberry
2013-11-09 16:30:51	itadder	if I recall

2013-11-09 16:38:42	itadder	but I had to contact each user one by one
2013-11-09 16:38:54	itadder	but it was powershell script that would migrate each mailbox no PST needed
2013-11-09 16:39:13	itadder	now when we did the client from alt-n to exchange 2003
2013-11-09 16:39:20	itadder	it was via PST like you said

2013-11-09 16:46:39	GeekDrew	if you're migrating between versions, you still need two servers
2013-11-09 16:46:42	itadder	it is easer to install and configure exchange 2010
2013-11-09 16:46:49	itadder	GeekDrew:  that true
2013-11-09 16:47:02	itadder	but I mean with 2007 you needed a front end exchange server and a backend

2013-11-09 16:47:22	GeekDrew	no you didn't. i ran exchange 2007 and exchange 2003 each on one box only

2013-11-09 16:48:50	GeekDrew	the difference is that with exchange you _could_ split them into multiple boxes if you wanted to, and you couldn't w/ mdaemon
2013-11-09 16:49:03	itadder	GeekDrew:  oh 
2013-11-09 16:49:06	GeekDrew	itadder: you could put multiple roles on the same server.

2013-11-09 17:20:51	GeekDrew	but i'm tired of how horribly "crashy" it is. hence looking at OSX.

2013-11-09 17:30:09	itadder	keep windows as the server os
2013-11-09 17:31:14	GeekDrew	because, from everything i've read and everyone i've talked to who has done that, OSX absolutely sucks from an administrative standpoint, with respect to restrictions and locking it down. plus there's training issues, compatibility issues, and i _still_ can't find any good exchange clients that "just work" as well as outlook 2010 does on windows.
2013-11-09 17:31:25	GeekDrew	and i also use linux servers - not just windows.

2013-11-09 17:45:28	itadder	and give end user at work a options, do you want to use a mac or windows
2013-11-09 17:45:32	GeekDrew	eh - the problem is that it requires a lot of application support, not just OS support
2013-11-09 17:45:50	GeekDrew	for example, i have policies that set options in Office, so that our users can't change them
2013-11-09 17:46:04	GeekDrew	and policies that reconfigure internet explorer to be compliant with certain regulations

2013-11-09 17:47:27	GeekDrew	i can have a dell workstation in place, with a monitor, and office, for $1000ish. total.
2013-11-09 17:47:27	itadder	and use vmware fusion to host MAC OS Vm
2013-11-09 17:47:39	itadder	and just have end users Remote in via thin clients
2013-11-09 17:47:45	itadder	sort of like citirxs
2013-11-09 17:47:46	GeekDrew	they aren't smart enough to do that. ;)

2013-11-09 17:50:31	GeekDrew	last i read, aquaconnect just uses a network of mac pro minis or desktops to form the "servers" to which the users connect.
2013-11-09 17:50:49	itadder	oh that lame
2013-11-09 17:51:12	itadder	so the end user is not connecting to a citirx like enviroment
2013-11-09 17:51:31	itadder	well a cheap option is to get macminis
2013-11-09 17:51:38	itadder	for 600 dollars
2013-11-09 17:51:52	Parth	virtualizing desktop environments for end users is really tricky, and it's just so SLOW

2013-11-09 23:47:43	@rorx	buu: I assume those are AppleDouble files, which are part of the file, so eliminating them, is effectively erasing data.
2013-11-09 23:48:44	@rorx	that sure sounds like the convention that Netatalk uses, maybe that's your server.

2013-11-09 23:54:19	buu	jmgk: Hello?
2013-11-09 23:57:44	@rorx	buu: I'd guess that your server doesn't have a filesystem that supports EAs, so it's forced to put data that would normally in those, in AppleDouble files to preserve it.
2013-11-09 23:59:08	buu	Well, yes, but A) what data is it putting in there and B) how do I disable it?
2013-11-09 23:59:08	@rorx	but then EA implementations vary as far as limits, so it could be possible that the server does that regardless, as the filesystem itself does'nt have those limits for regular files.
2013-11-09 23:59:13	jmgk	rorx,  reply 
2013-11-09 23:59:16	@rorx	buu: that is up to the application which creates the file.
2013-11-09 23:59:40	buu	rorx: Well, it appears to be triggered by having the folder mounted in finder..
2013-11-10 00:00:41	Wally	i'm having this issue with SMB shares
2013-11-10 00:01:13	@rorx	I'd guess if you're using 10.5+ there is a greater likelyhood that you would see those from OSX itself, as from that point forward the system started making use of EAs for some things.
2013-11-10 00:01:16	jmgk	rorx,  ?
2013-11-10 00:02:05	@rorx	I think you ought to consider that it _isn't_ an issue. B)

2013-11-10 14:05:26	mescalinum	m0dest: yeah, that's what I was saying: Document Container has not the standard behavior. on the other hand, the standard folder restriction is not part of the spotlight query
2013-11-10 14:05:31	m0dest	disappointing that spotlight offers this long list of mostly-useless metadata fields to query.  seems like the kind of thing win explorer would do.
2013-11-10 14:06:07	mescalinum	m0dest: the commandline approach is working fine:  mdfind "$query" | grep -v ^$path
2013-11-10 14:06:18	m0dest	mescalinum: it doesn't look like the scope is included in the raw query field.  open your .savedSearch in a text editor.  it's a separate parameter in the plist
2013-11-10 14:06:40	m0dest	i think it gets passed in as the equivalent of   mdfind -onlyin /my/path "$query"

2013-11-10 14:13:01	m0dest	it seems to be designed for maybe 5-10 tags like "Work" or "InProgress" and not a huge taxonomy of research topics
2013-11-10 14:13:11	mescalinum	but it happens only upon the creation of a new tag

2013-11-10 14:17:44	m0dest	hmm what do you mean by improved knowledge model?
2013-11-10 14:17:59	mescalinum	for one, a big limitation is that tag exist only in *unary* form, i.e. applied to only one file

2013-11-10 14:18:54	mescalinum	for example, a binary tag would express a relation between two files (i.e. file1 is-related-to file2)
2013-11-10 14:19:20	mescalinum	another limitation is that tags are non-parametric

2013-11-10 14:20:57	mescalinum	with a parametric tag you could define a tag, say 'Rating(x)' and for each file you tag with this tag, enter a parameter, in this case, numeric, in a certain domain
2013-11-10 14:21:27	m0dest	i'm already curious what portion of users actually understand the differences between folders and tags – it's rare for a product to have both and it's a challenging concept
2013-11-10 14:21:45	mescalinum	without parametric tags, in order to achieve this, you would have to ground the domain, i.e. create many tags (Rating_1, Rating_2, Rating_3....)

2013-11-10 14:22:16	m0dest	yeah i've seen that solved with hierarchical tags (Things for Mac does this with tags -- e.g.  Rating > *, Rating > **), but that's less elegant

2013-11-10 14:23:52	m0dest	gmail seems to get along fine with a tags-only model, but 90% of users don't need hierarchical mail folders anyways, so tags work fine as a simple 1-level concept
2013-11-10 14:24:07	m0dest	the problem is when people start needing hierarchy, the behavior of hierarchical tags is more confusing than folders
2013-11-10 14:24:15	mescalinum	one should be able to state that i.e. all the documents having tag "Biology" also should be like they also have the tag "Science"
2013-11-10 14:25:25	m0dest	yeah that's clear to me
2013-11-10 14:25:43	mescalinum	if people don't get it, they can just not use it
2013-11-10 14:26:17	mescalinum	in fact all those features (folders, unary tags, N-ary tags, parametric tags, tag hierarchy) are orthogonal with each other
2013-11-10 14:27:20	m0dest	right -- i'm assuming that many users just ignore mavericks tags, and they're never forced to learn about them unless they want to

2013-11-10 14:30:55	m0dest	Google Docs tried tag-only file management (albeit not anything as fancy as parametric tags), but i think they eventually went with hierarchical folders in Google Drive because of the constraints of syncing with a legacy filesystem

2013-11-10 14:32:54	mescalinum	i.e. a gmail tag corresponds to a folder. tagging a message corresponds to copying the message to a folder
2013-11-10 14:33:23	m0dest	you end up with multiple copies of the same message in different folders and stuff
2013-11-10 14:33:36	m0dest	it's passable for email but would drive people nuts in a filesystem

2013-11-10 17:33:09	jp-	there's a ton of hp software crashes there, i'm guessing maybe it's starting up when you login and could be the culprit, just guessing.
2013-11-10 17:34:16	jp-	so i suggest you move the loginitems config file i mentioned above to a temp folder and if that doesn't do it move the ~/Library/LaunchAgents to a temp folder as well
2013-11-10 17:34:30	jp-	that should effectively kill any software that is running when the user logs in.

2013-11-10 20:41:42	maya-	Once that's done, you can type exit and quit Terminal.  It'll take you back to the main window.
2013-11-10 20:41:58	maya-	And that's when you choose Disk Utility, and make your initial partition.
2013-11-10 20:42:21	maya-	And then you'll quit Disk Utility, and just install Mavericks. :D
2013-11-10 20:42:39	ekx	would it be faster if I just wiped the partition table somehow?

2013-11-10 20:44:36	ekx	I've also been told you just need to erase the first x bytes of a disk for it to effectively erase the partitioning table, letting you format it anew
2013-11-10 20:44:42	maya-	They say that so you can buy more HDDs or SSDs.
2013-11-10 20:44:55	Gorroth	okay, if you wish to believe that, keep doing it
2013-11-10 20:44:58	ekx	thanks for your help maya-

2013-11-10 20:45:38	ekx	:P
2013-11-10 20:45:39	mwilson	Writing zeros one time isn't going to seriously impact an SSD.
2013-11-10 20:45:52	gabedwrds	if it's a smart SSD, it won't write out all the zeros either
2013-11-10 20:45:52	mwilson	Now, if you tried to run DBAN on one or something.
2013-11-10 20:45:54	maya-	Thank you, mwilson.
2013-11-10 20:46:31	gabedwrds	it'll just go "oh, user doesn't want any of this, I won't shuffle things around to preserve it when new writes come in"
2013-11-10 20:46:43	Gorroth	we didn't say "one time"
2013-11-10 20:46:49	Gorroth	he said he does it occasionally
2013-11-10 20:47:01	mwilson	gabedwrds: Any such SSD should be immediately labeled as defective.
2013-11-10 20:47:20	mwilson	gabedwrds: Since when do nulls indicate that?
2013-11-10 20:47:25	ekx	I actually just cancelled it got 5% through the zeroing, and now it's letting me do everything in Disk Utility as I desired
2013-11-10 20:47:26	gabedwrds	I'm essentially describing SSD compression
2013-11-10 20:47:30	ekx	thanks guys!

2013-11-10 20:48:04	gabedwrds	200GB of data written to the SSD does not necessarily mean 200GB of bits written to flash
