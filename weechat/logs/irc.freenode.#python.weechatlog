2013-11-04 21:34:29	cdunklau	Surtri: ``"forward" and "walk forward" and "go forward" in answer`` will always evaluate true

2013-11-04 21:35:00	Surtri	When I do that though, even if the answer is just "walk" it will automatically go to forward

2013-11-04 21:35:02	cjwelborn	speaker123: class 'm'  (css right?) means 'Literal.Number'
2013-11-04 21:35:15	cdunklau	oisa: that does the same as ``"forward" in answer``
2013-11-04 21:35:29	cdunklau	oisa: since the chain of `or`s will return the first truthy thing

2013-11-04 21:35:32	cdunklau	:)
2013-11-04 21:36:06	cdunklau	Surtri: why are you calling the functions right after you define them?

A single line comment is a single line comment in any language. You could always test the different outputs, I kinda had to do that to make sure I was getting the colors I wanted.

2013-11-04 21:57:22	cdunklau	Surtri: if it was a good class/tutorial/whatever, you would already know what "calling a function" means

2013-11-04 21:59:15	cjwelborn	Surtri: if you call every function immediately after you define it, it kinda defeats the purpose of writing functions. you might as well have written straight code in the order you wanted it executed. (just trying to help)

I just want that function to be able to handle taking multiple points as well as single points. I might settle with multiple functions though, since it would probably be easier to read

2013-11-10 14:18:28	saboot	I have a question about proper usage of virtual python envs. I am going to start a few different python projects, which will have their own dependencies. My system python is 2.7 but I'd like to use a newer version. Should I get a python distribution (anaconda/enthrough), setup virtualenvs in that? Should I include site-packages, or install everything separately?

2013-11-10 14:19:22	pangur	So, how do I convert rows of districts each having an elder (some having the same elder) into rows of elders, each having a list of districts (which might only have one item in the list).
2013-11-10 14:19:25	pangur	?
2013-11-10 14:19:40	Nelluk	saboot: you can install newer versions of python alongside your s ystem version, and just point virtualenv at it when you create it. 'virtualenv myproject --python=/usr/bin/python3.3'

2013-11-10 14:57:51	Nine_9	hello there. a lot of people ask about code protection for python while comparing it to C++ which is compiled, unless I'm horribly wrong, there's cython which allows you to compile python stuff in C, however, no one cites it while answering such questions, i'm curious why... I mean, obviously it's no real code protection, but if C compiling is enough, python can do that too in most cases...
2013-11-10 14:57:51	Nine_9	...afaik. unless cython leaves conversion traces in the binaries or something.

2013-11-10 15:00:17	Yhg1s	Nine_9: Cython-compiled code is still easier to decompile than plain C code, because it has a limited set of patterns for Python code constructs. Also, it uses the CPython API a lot.

2013-11-10 15:13:21	Nine_9	ssbr, Yhg1s: well, I think cython works with pretty much any python program without modification, what's very cool, you only have to specify "C" types for the extra performance, pypy is a much better approach for my needs though, it seems cython is more focused on using C stuff in python, I'm mostly interested in performance. In 99% of cases cpython delivers the performance I need though.

2013-11-10 16:16:20	jennifer	NameError and TypeError, then exception.
2013-11-10 16:16:40	jennifer	NameError are generally when you don't define a variable and you use it.
2013-11-10 16:17:11	jennifer	TypeError is when you try to do things against type when you can't, like add an int and a tuple.

2013-11-10 16:24:21	\u03b5	anyway, it hides the sidebar when the window width is short
2013-11-10 16:24:43	Nine_9	nedbat: as I said, for decent code protection, saas is the way to go, if C compiled binaries are enough there's cython or even shedskin. giving up on protecting code is almost always the best way to go however. :)
2013-11-10 16:25:00	Nine_9	code protection is way too much overrated.

2013-11-10 16:28:18	Nine_9	I think most 'beginners' rely on the obfuscating programs for the other languages or they think compiling is somehow protecting the code effectively, so, when people start on python they miss the code protection stuff, that's mostly 'psychological' though. anyone motivated can break any protection, otherwise we won't see every pc game being cracked

2013-11-10 16:32:49	nedbat	emx: yes, you define a class, but in py2 there are two kinds of classes, and you need to derive from object if you want modern behavior.
2013-11-10 16:32:54	voo	reactormonk: machine learning generally assumes that you have a large number of trainings data available, do you have this or do you have some other knowledge about the correlation between input and output?

2013-11-10 17:48:42	cornjuliox	so i'm trying to understand the @property decorator. if i understand this right all functions have __get__() __set__() and __del__() methods , and the @property decorator returns a descriptor object that's basically the function you passed in with those 3 methods changed/overridden?

2013-11-10 17:49:07	neataroni	i have a list of objects, and i loop through that list and increment some attribute on each of those objects, but then later those attributes are unchanged
2013-11-10 17:49:13	speaker123	so pip was installed with the system python
2013-11-10 17:49:16	speaker123	not with the homebrew python
2013-11-10 17:49:18	_habnabit	cornjuliox, nope. it returns a 'property' descriptor. it _calls_ the function you pass, but i wouldn't say it's 'basically' the same function

2013-11-10 18:00:32	speaker123	sbma44, so immediately after "brew rm python && brew install python" what is the shebang on /usr/local/bin/pip?
2013-11-10 18:00:32	speaker123	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17271319/installing-pip-on-mac-os-x suggests pip is installed with homebrew python
2013-11-10 18:00:32	sbma44	_habnabit: so, brew rm python doesn't seem to remove much. which python still points to /usr/local/bin/python, and it still runs. pip and easy_install remain untouched, too

2013-11-10 19:22:42	tos9	Grievre: E.g., in general, if you ahve two objects, A using B, then one technique for testing the bond between those two is to write lots of unit tests for B that assert that it calculates correctly with different important input values

2013-11-10 19:24:38	tos9	Grievre: The test that you'll end up writing for that integration part will probably end up being very much like "hey I shove some input in and then this is the input that should get passed all the way out to B"
2013-11-10 19:25:14	tos9	Grievre: Yeah, so, you may have the right idea in that you can certainly add unit tests for your B to narrow down possible error conditions
2013-11-10 19:25:28	tos9	Grievre: That's just giving B more behavior though
2013-11-10 19:25:28	Grievre	can you rephrase/expand that?
2013-11-10 19:25:54	tos9	Grievre: So, you can add some behavior to B that says "if it gets a str then it raises a TypeError, because it expects an object of type XYZ, not a str"

2013-11-10 19:28:58	Grievre	tos9, I guess a broad test like checking that it's an instance of object wouldn't be too bad

2013-11-10 19:32:42	Grievre	tos9, so the real problem is that some of the constraints are not easy to check in a nilpotent manner. For example one function might have an argument whose only constraint is that it be an object with a "checkWidget" method which does not throw ValueError when you pass it a string
2013-11-10 19:32:48	Stormer97	okay, so I am writing some code to compress/decompress text (purely for educational purposes, I'm not tryint to compete with 7zip or anything), and I'm trying to write the part that decompresses it, and I'm getting a really odd error (standby, pastebin link incoming)

2013-11-10 19:46:29	Grievre	tos9, okay, for example, we have classes for each switching ASIC chip they have. They usually have a method called trafficTest and often this method takes a string parameter called "loopback". The users of one /particular/ class pass it the values "mac", "phy" and "none"
2013-11-10 19:46:34	tos9	Grievre: Then as you understand more, you can either narrow that, or break out some new objects with narrower interfaces.

2013-11-10 22:30:15	cap_sensitive	Hi. I have both python 3 (the default one) and python 2 installed, and I set PYTHONPATH to include all 2.x and 3.x libs. The problems is, pip for version 2 can see the py 3.x lib, and vice versa. Any solutions for that?
2013-11-10 22:30:34	KirkMcDonald	cap_sensitive: Sure. Don't use PYTHONPATH in this way.

2013-11-10 22:30:54	cap_sensitive	KirkMcDonald: so what's the correct way to do that?
2013-11-10 22:31:08	KirkMcDonald	cap_sensitive: To do what, exactly?

2013-11-10 22:32:16	cap_sensitive	KirkMcDonald: to somehow include python libs so that both python 2 and 3 can import them without problem, and they do not 'see' the incompatible versions of the libraries.
2013-11-10 22:33:08	KirkMcDonald	cap_sensitive: Python 2 and 3 are incompatible languages. It makes relatively little sense to try to make a library visible to both.
2013-11-10 22:33:21	KirkMcDonald	cap_sensitive: A given library will either be for Python 2 or for Python 3.
2013-11-10 22:33:40	mtahmed	dash: I know what the "norm" is.

2013-11-10 22:33:47	mtahmed	Which is what I am trying to avoid.
2013-11-10 22:33:52	KirkMcDonald	cap_sensitive: At the very least, you'd want two installations of it, one for each Python.
2013-11-10 22:34:06	cap_sensitive	KirkMcDonald: I do have 2 separate dirs for them
2013-11-10 22:34:09	mtahmed	dash: Why do I have to justify my use to you again?
2013-11-10 22:34:25	nso95	I'm trying to learn to program, but all the books and tutorials just seem to list some functions and statements, but don't actually teach you how to program

2013-11-10 22:34:41	cap_sensitive	KirkMcDonald: But I need to include both of the dirs in PYTHONPATH so that both python 2 and 3 can find the libs that I installed
2013-11-10 22:34:43	ssbr	nso95: the books and tutorials aimed at programmers will be like that :(
2013-11-10 22:34:53	KirkMcDonald	cap_sensitive: Either place the libraries somewhere that Python will find without needing to set PYTHONPATH, or set PYTHONPATH when you run Python.
